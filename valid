it can be a very complicated thing , the ocean .
and it can be a very complicated thing , what human health is .
and bringing those two together might seem a very da@@ un@@ ting task , but what I &apos;m going to try to say is that even in that complexity , there &apos;s some simple the@@ m@@ es that I think , if we understand , we can really move forward .
and those simple the@@ m@@ es aren &apos;t really the@@ m@@ es about the complex science of what &apos;s going on , but things that we all pretty well know .
and I &apos;m going to start with this one : if m@@ om@@ ma ain &apos;t happy , ain &apos;t nobody happy .
we know that , right ? we &apos;ve experi@@ enced that .
and if we just take that and we build from there , then we can go to the next step , which is that if the ocean ain &apos;t happy , ain &apos;t nobody happy .
that &apos;s the the@@ me of my talk .
and we &apos;re making the ocean pretty un@@ happy in a lot of different ways .
this is a shot of Can@@ ner@@ y Ro@@ w in 19@@ 32 .
Can@@ ner@@ y Ro@@ w , at the time , had the biggest industrial can@@ ning operation on the west co@@ ast .
we pil@@ ed enormous amoun@@ ts of poll@@ ution into the air and into the water .
R@@ ol@@ f B@@ ol@@ in , who was a professor at the H@@ op@@ k@@ in &apos;s Mar@@ ine Sta@@ tion where I work , wrote in the 194@@ 0s that &quot; The f@@ um@@ es from the sc@@ um flo@@ ating on the in@@ lets of the b@@ ay were so bad they turned lead @-@ based pain@@ ts black . &quot;
people working in these can@@ n@@ eri@@ es could bar@@ ely stay there all day because of the smell , but you know what they came out saying ?
they say , &quot; You know what you smell ?
you smell money . &quot;
that poll@@ ution was money to that community , and those people de@@ alt with the poll@@ ution and absor@@ bed it into their skin and into their bodies because they needed the money .
we made the ocean un@@ happy ; we made people very un@@ happy , and we made them un@@ healthy .
the connection between ocean health and human health is actually based upon another couple simple a@@ da@@ ges , and I want to call that &quot; p@@ in@@ ch a min@@ now , hur@@ t a wh@@ ale . &quot;
the p@@ yrami@@ d of ocean life ...
now , when an ec@@ ologist looks at the ocean -- I have to tell you -- we look at the ocean in a very different way , and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean because when an ec@@ ologist looks at the ocean , we see all those inter@@ connections .
we see the base of the food chain , the plan@@ k@@ ton , the small things , and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the p@@ yrami@@ d , and on so up this diag@@ ra@@ m .
and that flow , that flow of life , from the very base up to the very top , is the flow that ec@@ ologists see .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to pres@@ erve when we say , &quot; Sa@@ ve the ocean . he@@ al the ocean . &quot;
it &apos;s that p@@ yrami@@ d .
now why does that matter for human health ?
because when we j@@ am things in the bottom of that p@@ yrami@@ d that shouldn &apos;t be there , some very fri@@ gh@@ tening things happen .
poll@@ ut@@ ants , some poll@@ ut@@ ants have been created by us : molecules like P@@ C@@ B@@ s that can &apos;t be broken down by our bodies .
and they go in the base of that p@@ yrami@@ d , and they dri@@ ft up ; they &apos;re passed up that way , on to pre@@ dat@@ ors and on to the top pre@@ dat@@ ors , and in so doing , they acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ate .
now , to bring that home , I thought I &apos;d inv@@ ent a little game .
we don &apos;t really have to play it ; we can just think about it here .
it &apos;s the St@@ y@@ ro@@ fo@@ am and cho@@ col@@ ate game .
imagine that when we got on this boat , we were all given two St@@ y@@ ro@@ fo@@ am pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts .
can &apos;t do much with them : put them in your po@@ cket .
suppose the rules are : every time you offer somebody a dr@@ ink , you give them the dr@@ ink , and you give them your St@@ y@@ ro@@ fo@@ am pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts too .
what &apos;ll happen is that the St@@ y@@ ro@@ fo@@ am pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts will start moving through our society here , and they will acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ate in the dr@@ unk@@ est , st@@ in@@ gi@@ est people .
there &apos;s no mechan@@ ism in this game for them to go anywhere but into a bigger and bigger pi@@ le of indi@@ ges@@ ti@@ ble St@@ y@@ ro@@ fo@@ am pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens with P@@ D@@ B@@ s in this food p@@ yrami@@ d : they acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ate into the top of it .
now suppose , instead of St@@ y@@ ro@@ fo@@ am pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts , we take these lo@@ vely little cho@@ col@@ ates that we get and we had those instead .
well , some of us would be eating those cho@@ col@@ ates instead of pas@@ sing them around , and instead of acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ating , they will just pass into our group here and not acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ate in any one group because they &apos;re absor@@ bed by us .
and that &apos;s the difference between a P@@ C@@ B and , say , something natural like an om@@ eg@@ a @-@ 3 , something we want out of the mar@@ ine food chain .
P@@ C@@ B@@ s acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ate .
we have great examples of that , unfortunately .
P@@ C@@ B@@ s acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ate in dolph@@ ins in Sar@@ as@@ ota Bay , in Texas , in North Carol@@ ina .
they get into the food chain .
the dolph@@ ins eat the fish that have P@@ C@@ B@@ s from the plan@@ k@@ ton , and those P@@ C@@ B@@ s , being fat @-@ sol@@ u@@ ble , acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ate in these dolph@@ ins .
now , a dolph@@ in , mother dolph@@ in , any dolph@@ in -- there &apos;s only one way that a P@@ C@@ B can get out of a dolph@@ in .
and what &apos;s that ?
in mother &apos;s mil@@ k .
here &apos;s a diag@@ ra@@ m of the P@@ C@@ B load of dolph@@ ins in Sar@@ as@@ ota Bay .
adult mal@@ es : a huge load .
ju@@ ven@@ il@@ es : a huge load .
fem@@ ales after their first cal@@ f is already we@@ an@@ ed : a lower load .
those fem@@ ales , they &apos;re not trying to .
those fem@@ ales are pas@@ sing the P@@ C@@ B@@ s in the fat of their own mother &apos;s mil@@ k into their off@@ spring , and their off@@ spring don &apos;t survive .
the death rate in these dolph@@ ins , for the first cal@@ f born of every female dolph@@ in , is 60 to 80 percent .
these mothers p@@ ump their first off@@ spring full of this poll@@ ut@@ ant , and most of them die .
now , the mother then can go and re@@ produce , but what a terrible price to pay for the acc@@ um@@ ulation of this poll@@ ut@@ ant in these animals -- the death of the first @-@ born cal@@ f .
there &apos;s another top pre@@ dat@@ or in the ocean , it turns out .
that top pre@@ dat@@ or , of course , is us .
and we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places .
this is wh@@ ale meat that I photograph@@ ed in a gro@@ cer@@ y store in T@@ ok@@ yo -- or is it ?
in fact , what we did a few years ago was learn how to s@@ mu@@ ggle a molecular biology lab into T@@ ok@@ yo and use it to gene@@ tically test the DNA out of wh@@ ale meat sam@@ ples and identi@@ fy what they really were .
and some of those wh@@ ale meat sam@@ ples were wh@@ ale meat .
some of them were illegal wh@@ ale meat , by the way .
that &apos;s another story .
but some of them were not wh@@ ale meat at all .
even though they were lab@@ el@@ ed wh@@ ale meat , they were dolph@@ in meat .
some of them were dolph@@ in liver . some of them were dolph@@ in blu@@ b@@ ber .
and those dolph@@ in parts had a huge load of P@@ C@@ B@@ s , di@@ o@@ x@@ ins and heavy met@@ als .
and that huge load was pas@@ sing into the people that ate this meat .
it turns out that a lot of dolph@@ ins are being sold as meat in the wh@@ ale meat market around the world .
that &apos;s a tra@@ ge@@ dy for those popul@@ ations , but it &apos;s also a tra@@ ge@@ dy for the people eating them because they don &apos;t know that that &apos;s tox@@ ic meat .
we had these data a few years ago .
I remember sitting at my des@@ k being about the only person in the world who knew that wh@@ ale meat being sold in these markets was really dolph@@ in meat , and it was tox@@ ic .
it had two @-@ to @-@ three @-@ to @-@ 400 times the tox@@ ic lo@@ ads ever allowed by the E@@ PA .
and I remember there sitting at my des@@ k thinking , &quot; Well , I know this . this is a great scientific discovery , &quot; but it was so awful .
and for the very first time in my scientific career , I bro@@ ke scientific pro@@ to@@ co@@ l , which is that you take the data and publ@@ ish them in scientific journ@@ als and then begin to talk about them .
we sent a very poli@@ te letter to the Min@@ ister of He@@ alth in Japan and simply poin@@ ted out that this is an in@@ toler@@ able situation , not for us , but for the people of Japan because mothers who may be bre@@ ast@@ fe@@ eding , who may have young children , would be bu@@ ying something that they thought was healthy , but it was really tox@@ ic .
that led to a whole series of other cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ns in Japan , and I &apos;m really proud to say that at this point , it &apos;s very difficult to buy anything in Japan that &apos;s lab@@ el@@ ed in@@ cor@@ rec@@ tly , even though they &apos;re still selling wh@@ ale meat , which I believe they shouldn &apos;t .
but at least it &apos;s lab@@ el@@ ed cor@@ rec@@ tly , and you &apos;re no longer going to be bu@@ ying tox@@ ic dolph@@ in meat instead .
it isn &apos;t just there that this happens , but in a natural diet of some communities in the Can@@ a@@ dian ar@@ c@@ tic and in the United States and in the European ar@@ c@@ tic , a natural diet of se@@ als and wh@@ ales leads to an acc@@ um@@ ulation of P@@ C@@ B@@ s that have gather@@ ed up from all parts of the world and ended up in these women .
these women have tox@@ ic breast mil@@ k .
they cannot feed their off@@ spring , their children , their breast mil@@ k because of the acc@@ um@@ ulation of these tox@@ ins in their food chain , in their part of the world &apos;s ocean p@@ yrami@@ d .
that means their imm@@ une systems are com@@ promis@@ ed .
it means that their children &apos;s development can be com@@ promis@@ ed .
and the world &apos;s attention on this over the last decade has reduc@@ ed the problem for these women , not by changing the p@@ yrami@@ d , but by changing what they particularly eat out of it .
we &apos;ve taken them out of their natural p@@ yrami@@ d in order to solve this problem .
that &apos;s a good thing for this particular ac@@ ute problem , but it does nothing to solve the p@@ yrami@@ d problem .
there &apos;s other ways of brea@@ king the p@@ yrami@@ d .
the p@@ yrami@@ d , if we j@@ am things in the bottom , can get bac@@ ked up like a se@@ wer line that &apos;s c@@ log@@ ged .
and if we j@@ am nutri@@ ents , se@@ wa@@ ge , fer@@ tili@@ zer in the base of that food p@@ yrami@@ d , it can back up all through it .
we end up with things we &apos;ve heard about before : red ti@@ des , for example , which are blo@@ oms of tox@@ ic al@@ ga@@ e flo@@ ating through the oceans caus@@ ing neuro@@ lo@@ gical damage .
we can also see blo@@ oms of bacteria , blo@@ oms of viruses in the ocean .
these are two sh@@ ots of a red ti@@ de coming on sh@@ ore here and a bacteria in the gen@@ us vi@@ bri@@ o , which inclu@@ des the gen@@ us that has ch@@ ol@@ era in it .
how many people have seen a &quot; be@@ ach closed &quot; sign ?
why does that happen ?
it happens because we have j@@ am@@ m@@ ed so much into the base of the natural ocean p@@ yrami@@ d that these bacteria clo@@ g it up and over@@ fill onto our be@@ ach@@ es .
often what j@@ ams us up is se@@ wa@@ ge .
now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying , &quot; C@@ los@@ ed because human se@@ wa@@ ge is so far over this park that you can &apos;t use it &quot; ?
not very often . we wouldn &apos;t toler@@ ate that .
we wouldn &apos;t toler@@ ate our par@@ ks being s@@ w@@ amp@@ ed by human se@@ wa@@ ge , but be@@ ach@@ es are closed a lot in our country .
they &apos;re closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason , and I believe we shouldn &apos;t toler@@ ate that either .
it &apos;s not just a question of cle@@ an@@ lin@@ ess ; it &apos;s also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease .
these vi@@ bri@@ os , these bacteria , can actually infe@@ ct people .
they can go into your skin and create skin infe@@ ctions .
this is a graph from N@@ O@@ A@@ A &apos;s ocean and human health initi@@ ative , showing the rise of the infe@@ ctions by vi@@ bri@@ o in people over the last few years .
sur@@ f@@ ers , for example , know this incredibly .
and if you can see on some sur@@ fing sites , in fact , not only do you see what the waves are like or what the weather &apos;s like , but on some sur@@ f ri@@ der sites , you see a little flas@@ hing po@@ o al@@ ert .
that means that the be@@ ach might have great waves , but it &apos;s a dangerous place for sur@@ f@@ ers to be because they can carry with them , even after a great day of sur@@ fing , this leg@@ acy of an infe@@ ction that might take a very long time to solve .
some of these infe@@ ctions are actually car@@ rying anti@@ bio@@ tic resist@@ ance genes now , and that makes them even more difficult .
these same infe@@ ctions create har@@ m@@ ful al@@ g@@ al blo@@ oms .
those blo@@ oms are gener@@ ating other kinds of chemicals .
this is just a simple list of some of the types of po@@ is@@ ons that come out of these har@@ m@@ ful al@@ g@@ al blo@@ oms : sh@@ ell@@ fish po@@ is@@ on@@ ing , fish ci@@ gu@@ at@@ era , di@@ ar@@ r@@ hei@@ c sh@@ ell@@ fish po@@ is@@ on@@ ing -- you don &apos;t want to know about that -- neuro@@ tox@@ ic sh@@ ell@@ fish po@@ is@@ on@@ ing , par@@ aly@@ tic sh@@ ell@@ fish po@@ is@@ on@@ ing .
these are things that are getting into our food chain because of these blo@@ oms .
R@@ it@@ a Cal@@ well very fam@@ ously tra@@ ced a very interesting story of ch@@ ol@@ era into human communities , brought there , not by a normal human v@@ ec@@ tor , but by a mar@@ ine v@@ ec@@ tor , this cop@@ e@@ po@@ d .
cop@@ e@@ po@@ ds are small cru@@ st@@ ace@@ ans .
they &apos;re a tiny fra@@ ction of an in@@ ch long , and they can carry on their little legs some of the ch@@ ol@@ era bacteria that then leads to human disease .
that has spar@@ ked ch@@ ol@@ era epide@@ mi@@ cs in por@@ ts along the world and has led to increas@@ ed concent@@ ration on trying to make sure shi@@ pping doesn &apos;t move these v@@ ec@@ tors of ch@@ ol@@ era around the world .
so what do you do ?
we have major problems in dis@@ rup@@ ted ecos@@ ystem flow that the p@@ yrami@@ d may not be working so well , that the flow from the base up into it is being blo@@ cked and c@@ log@@ ged .
what do you do when you have this sort of dis@@ rup@@ ted flow ?
well , there &apos;s a bunch of things you could do .
you could call Jo@@ e the P@@ l@@ um@@ ber , for example .
and he could come in and fix the flow .
but in fact , if you look around the world , not only are there hope sp@@ ots for where we may be able to fix problems , there have been places where problems have been fix@@ ed , where people have come to gri@@ ps with these issues and be@@ gun to turn them around .
Mon@@ ter@@ ey is one of those .
I started out showing how much we had dis@@ tr@@ essed the Mon@@ ter@@ ey Bay ecos@@ ystem with poll@@ ution and the can@@ ning industry and all of the atten@@ d@@ ant problems .
in 19@@ 32 , that &apos;s the picture .
in 2009 , the picture is drama@@ tically different .
the can@@ n@@ eri@@ es are gone . the poll@@ ution has ab@@ ated .
but there &apos;s a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working ecos@@ ystem@@ s .
they need a func@@ tioning p@@ yrami@@ d from the base all the way to the top .
and that p@@ yrami@@ d in Mon@@ ter@@ ey , right now , because of the eff@@ or@@ ts of a lot of different people , is func@@ tioning better than it &apos;s ever func@@ tioned for the last 150 years .
it didn &apos;t happen acci@@ dent@@ ally .
it happened because many people put their time and effort and their pi@@ on@@ e@@ ering spirit into this .
on the left there , Juli@@ a P@@ l@@ at@@ t , the ma@@ yo@@ r of my little hom@@ et@@ own in Pacific G@@ ro@@ ve .
at 7@@ 4 years old , became ma@@ yo@@ r because something had to be done to protect the ocean .
in 19@@ 3@@ 1 , she produced California &apos;s first community @-@ based mar@@ ine prote@@ cted area , right next to the biggest poll@@ uting can@@ ner@@ y , because Juli@@ a knew that when the can@@ n@@ eri@@ es eventually were gone , the ocean needed a place to grow from , that the ocean needed a place to spar@@ k a se@@ ed , and she wanted to provide that se@@ ed .
other people , like David P@@ ack@@ ard and J@@ ul@@ ie P@@ ack@@ ard , who were instru@@ mental in producing the Mon@@ ter@@ ey Bay a@@ qu@@ ari@@ um to lock into people &apos;s notion that the ocean and the health of the ocean ecos@@ ystem were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the ecos@@ ystem would be .
that change in thinking has led to a drama@@ tic shift , not only in the fortun@@ es of Mon@@ ter@@ ey Bay , but other places around the world .
well , I want to leave you with the thought that what we &apos;re really trying to do here is protect this ocean p@@ yrami@@ d , and that ocean p@@ yrami@@ d conne@@ cts to our own p@@ yrami@@ d of life .
it &apos;s an ocean planet , and we think of ourselves as a ter@@ res@@ trial species , but the p@@ yrami@@ d of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are in@@ tri@@ c@@ ately connected .
and it &apos;s only through having the ocean being healthy that we can re@@ main healthy ourselves .
thank you very much .
Ste@@ phen Pal@@ um@@ b@@ i : following the mer@@ cur@@ y tra@@ il
there &apos;s a ti@@ ght and surprising link between the ocean &apos;s health and ours , says mar@@ ine biolog@@ ist Ste@@ phen Pal@@ um@@ b@@ i . he shows how tox@@ ins at the bottom of the ocean food chain find their way into our bodies , with a sho@@ cking story of tox@@ ic cont@@ am@@ ination from a Japanese fish market . his work points a way forward for saving the oceans &apos; health -- and humanity &apos;s .
A@@ dri@@ an K@@ o@@ h@@ l@@ er : well , we &apos;re here today to talk about the evolution of a pu@@ p@@ pet hor@@ se .
B@@ as@@ il J@@ ones : but actually we &apos;re going to start this evolution with a hy@@ en@@ a .
A@@ K : the ancest@@ or of the hor@@ se .
okay , we &apos;ll do something with it .
Ha@@ ha@@ ha@@ ha .
the hy@@ en@@ a is the ancest@@ or of the hor@@ se because it was part of a production called &quot; F@@ au@@ st@@ us in Africa , &quot; a H@@ and@@ spring Pro@@ duc@@ tion from 199@@ 5 , where it had to play dr@@ au@@ ghts with H@@ el@@ en of T@@ ro@@ y .
this production was direc@@ ted by South African artist and theater direc@@ tor , Willi@@ am K@@ ent@@ ri@@ dge .
so it needed a very artic@@ ul@@ ate front pa@@ w .
but , like all pu@@ pp@@ ets , it has other at@@ trib@@ utes .
B@@ J : one of them is bre@@ ath , and it kind of brea@@ th@@ es .
A@@ K : ha@@ a ha@@ a ha@@ a@@ a .
B@@ J : bre@@ ath is really important for us .
it &apos;s the kind of original movement for any pu@@ p@@ pet for us on@@ stage .
it &apos;s the thing that dist@@ ingu@@ ish@@ es the pu@@ p@@ pet -- A@@ K : o@@ ops .
B@@ J : from an actor .
pu@@ pp@@ ets always have to try to be alive .
it &apos;s their kind of ur @-@ story on@@ stage , that des@@ per@@ ation to live .
A@@ K : yeah , it &apos;s basically a dead object , as you can see , and it only lives because you make it .
an actor stru@@ ggl@@ es to die on@@ stage , but a pu@@ p@@ pet has to stru@@ ggle to live .
and in a way that &apos;s a metaphor for life .
B@@ J : so every moment it &apos;s on the stage , it &apos;s making the stru@@ ggle .
so we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up @-@ to @-@ the @-@ minute 17@@ th century technology -- to turn no@@ uns into ver@@ bs .
A@@ K : well actually I pre@@ fer to say that it &apos;s an object constru@@ cted out of wood and cl@@ oth with movement built into it to per@@ su@@ ade you to believe that it has life .
B@@ J : okay so .
A@@ K : it has ears that move passi@@ vely when the head goes .
B@@ J : and it has these bul@@ k@@ heads made out of pl@@ y@@ wood , covered with fabri@@ c -- curi@@ ously similar , in fact , to the pl@@ y@@ wood can@@ oes that A@@ dri@@ an &apos;s father used to make when he was a boy in their work@@ shop .
A@@ K : in P@@ ort Eli@@ z@@ ab@@ eth , the village outside P@@ ort Eli@@ z@@ ab@@ eth in South Africa .
B@@ J : his mother was a pu@@ pp@@ et@@ eer .
and when we met at art school and fell in love in 197@@ 1 , I hat@@ ed pu@@ pp@@ ets .
I really thought they were so ben@@ e@@ ath me .
I wanted to become an av@@ ant @-@ gar@@ de artist -- and P@@ unch and Ju@@ dy was certainly not where I wanted to go .
and , in fact , it took about 10 years to discover the B@@ am@@ bar@@ a B@@ am@@ ana pu@@ pp@@ ets of Mal@@ i in West Africa , where there &apos;s a f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous tradi@@ tion of pu@@ pp@@ etry , to learn a ren@@ e@@ wed , or a new , respect for this art form .
A@@ K : so in 198@@ 1 , I per@@ su@@ aded B@@ as@@ il and some friends of mine to form a pu@@ p@@ pet company .
and 20 years later , mi@@ ra@@ cul@@ ously , we collabor@@ ated with a company from Mal@@ i , the S@@ og@@ ol@@ on M@@ ari@@ on@@ ette T@@ r@@ ou@@ pe of B@@ ama@@ k@@ o , where we made a piece about a t@@ all gi@@ ra@@ ff@@ e .
it was just called &quot; T@@ all H@@ or@@ se , &quot; which was a life @-@ si@@ zed gi@@ ra@@ ff@@ e .
B@@ J : and here again , you see the same structure .
the bul@@ k@@ heads have now turned into ho@@ ops of can@@ e , but it &apos;s ultimately the same structure .
it &apos;s got two people inside it on sti@@ l@@ ts , which give them the hei@@ ght , and somebody in the front who &apos;s using a kind of ste@@ ering whe@@ el to move that head .
A@@ K : the person in the h@@ ind legs is also controll@@ ing the tail , a bit like the hy@@ en@@ a -- same mechan@@ ism , just a bit bigger .
and he &apos;s controll@@ ing the ear movement .
B@@ J : so this production was seen by Tom Mor@@ r@@ is of the National The@@ at@@ re in London .
and just around that time , his mother had said , &quot; Ha@@ ve you seen this book by Michael Mor@@ pur@@ go called &apos; War H@@ or@@ se &apos; ? &quot;
A@@ K : it &apos;s about a boy who falls in love with a hor@@ se .
the hor@@ se is sold to the F@@ ir@@ st World War , and he jo@@ ins up to find his hor@@ se .
B@@ J : so Tom gave us a call and said , &quot; D@@ o you think you could make us a hor@@ se for a show to happen at the National The@@ at@@ re ? &quot;
A@@ K : it seemed a lo@@ vely idea .
B@@ J : but it had to ri@@ de . it had to have a ri@@ der .
A@@ K : it had to have a ri@@ der , and it had to particip@@ ate in ca@@ val@@ ry char@@ ges .
a play about early 20th century p@@ lo@@ wing technology and ca@@ val@@ ry char@@ ges was a little bit of a challenge for the accoun@@ ting de@@ partment at the National The@@ at@@ re in London .
but they agre@@ ed to go along with it for a while .
so we began with a test .
B@@ J : this is A@@ dri@@ an and Th@@ ys St@@ ander , who went on to actually design the can@@ e system for the hor@@ se , and our next @-@ door neighb@@ or Ka@@ ther@@ ine , ri@@ ding on a lad@@ der .
the weight is really difficult when it &apos;s up above your head .
A@@ K : and once we put Ka@@ ther@@ ine through that particular brand of hell , we knew that we might be able to make a hor@@ se , which could be ri@@ d@@ den .
so we made a model .
this is a car@@ d@@ board model , a little bit smaller than the hy@@ en@@ a .
you &apos;ll notice that the legs are pl@@ y@@ wood legs and the can@@ o@@ e structure is still there .
B@@ J : and the two mani@@ pul@@ ators are inside .
but we didn &apos;t realize at the time that we actually needed a third mani@@ pul@@ ator , because we couldn &apos;t mani@@ pul@@ ate the ne@@ ck from inside and walk the hor@@ se at the same time .
A@@ K : we started work on the protot@@ ype after the model was appro@@ ved , and the protot@@ ype took a bit longer than we an@@ ticip@@ ated .
we had to throw out the pl@@ y@@ wood legs and make new can@@ e ones .
and we had a cra@@ te built for it .
it had to be shi@@ pped to London .
we were going to test @-@ drive it on the street outside of our house in C@@ ape T@@ own , and it got to mi@@ d@@ night and we hadn &apos;t done that yet .
B@@ J : so we got a camera , and we posed the pu@@ p@@ pet in various g@@ allo@@ ping stan@@ ces .
and we sent it off to the National The@@ at@@ re , hop@@ ing that they believed that we created something that worked .
A@@ K : a month later , we were there in London with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us .
B@@ J : about 40 people .
A@@ K : we were terri@@ fied .
we opened the li@@ d , we took the hor@@ se out , and it did work ; it walked and it was able to be ri@@ d@@ den .
here I have an 18 @-@ second cli@@ p of the very first walk of the protot@@ ype .
this is in the National The@@ at@@ re studio , the place where they co@@ ok new ideas .
it had by no means got the green light yet .
the ch@@ or@@ e@@ ograp@@ her , To@@ by Se@@ d@@ g@@ wi@@ ck , invented a beautiful sequence where the baby hor@@ se , which was made out of sti@@ cks and bits of t@@ wi@@ gs , grew up into the big hor@@ se .
and N@@ ick St@@ ar@@ r , the direc@@ tor of the National The@@ at@@ re , saw that particular moment , he was standing next to me -- he nearly we@@ t himself .
and so the show was given the green light .
and we went back to C@@ ape T@@ own and re@@ designed the hor@@ se completely .
here is the plan .
and here is our factory in C@@ ape T@@ own where we make hor@@ ses .
you can see quite a lot of skelet@@ ons in the background there .
the hor@@ ses are completely hand@@ made .
there is very little 20th century technology in them .
we used a bit of las@@ er cutting on the pl@@ y@@ wood and some of the al@@ um@@ in@@ um pieces .
but because they have to be light and flexi@@ ble , and each one of them is different , they can &apos;t be mass @-@ produced , unfortunately .
so here are some half @-@ finished hor@@ ses ready to be worked in London .
and now we would like to introdu@@ ce you to Jo@@ ey .
Jo@@ ey boy , you there ?
Jo@@ ey , come here .
no , no , I haven &apos;t got it .
he &apos;s got it ; it &apos;s in his po@@ cket .
B@@ J : Jo@@ ey .
A@@ K : Jo@@ ey , Jo@@ ey , Jo@@ ey , Jo@@ ey .
come here . stand here where people can see you .
move around . come on .
I &apos;d just like to describe -- I won &apos;t talk too l@@ oud . he might get ir@@ rit@@ ated .
here , Cra@@ i@@ g is working the head .
he has b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle bra@@ ke c@@ ables going down to the head control in his hand .
each one of them oper@@ ates either an ear , separ@@ ately , or the head , up and down .
but he also contro@@ ls the head directly by using his hand .
the ears are obviously a very important emotional indic@@ ator of the hor@@ se .
when they point right back , the hor@@ se is f@@ ear@@ ful or an@@ gry , depen@@ ding upon what &apos;s going on in front of him , around him .
or , when he &apos;s more rel@@ ax@@ ed , the head comes down and the ears listen , either side .
hor@@ ses &apos; hearing is very important .
it &apos;s almost more important than their ey@@ es@@ ight .
over here , T@@ om@@ my &apos;s got what you call the heart position .
he &apos;s working the leg .
you see the str@@ ing ten@@ don from the hy@@ en@@ a , the hy@@ en@@ a &apos;s front leg , autom@@ a@@ tically pul@@ ls the ho@@ op up .
hor@@ ses are so un@@ predi@@ ct@@ able .
the way a ho@@ of comes up with a hor@@ se immediately gives you the feeling that it &apos;s a convin@@ cing hor@@ se action .
the h@@ ind legs have got the same action .
B@@ J : and M@@ ik@@ ey also has , in his fing@@ ers , the ability to move the tail from left to right , and up and down with the other hand .
and together , there &apos;s quite a complex possibility of tail expression .
A@@ K : you want to say something about the brea@@ thing ?
B@@ J : we had a big challenge with brea@@ thing .
A@@ dri@@ an thought that he was going to have to sp@@ lit the ch@@ est of the pu@@ p@@ pet in two and make it brea@@ the like that -- because that &apos;s how a hor@@ se would brea@@ the , with an exp@@ and@@ ed ch@@ est .
but we realized that , if that were to be happening , you wouldn &apos;t , as an audience , see the bre@@ ath .
so he made a chan@@ nel in here , and the ch@@ est moves up and down in that chan@@ nel .
so it &apos;s anti @-@ natur@@ alis@@ tic really , the up and down movement , but it feels like bre@@ ath .
and it &apos;s very , very simple because all that happens is that the pu@@ pp@@ et@@ eer brea@@ th@@ es with his k@@ ne@@ es .
A@@ K : other emotional stuff .
if I were to touch the hor@@ se here on his skin , the heart pu@@ pp@@ et@@ eer can sha@@ ke the body from inside and get the skin to qui@@ ver .
you &apos;ll notice , of course , that the pu@@ p@@ pet is made out of can@@ e lines .
and I would like you to believe that it was an a@@ es@@ thetic choice , that I was making a three @-@ dimensional drawing of a hor@@ se that somehow moves in space .
but of course , it was the can@@ e is light , and the can@@ e is mol@@ d@@ able .
and so it was a very practical reason why it was made of can@@ e .
the skin itself is made out of a see @-@ through n@@ yl@@ on mes@@ h , which , if the li@@ ghting designer wants the hor@@ se to almost disappe@@ ar , she can light the background and the hor@@ se becomes gh@@ os@@ t@@ like .
you see the skelet@@ al structure of it .
or if you light it from above , it becomes more soli@@ d .
again , that was a practical consi@@ der@@ ation .
the guys inside the hor@@ se have to be able to see out .
they have to be able to act And it &apos;s very much an in @-@ the @-@ moment activity that they &apos;re eng@@ aged in .
it &apos;s three heads making one character .
but now we would like you to put Jo@@ ey through some pac@@ es .
and plant .
thank you .
and now just -- All the way from sun@@ ny California we have Z@@ em Jo@@ a@@ qu@@ in who &apos;s going to ri@@ de the hor@@ se for us .
so we would like to stres@@ s that the performance you see in the hor@@ se is three guys who have studied hor@@ se behavior incredibly th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly .
B@@ J : not being able to talk to one another while they &apos;re on@@ stage because they &apos;re mic &apos;d .
the sound that that very large ch@@ est makes , of the hor@@ se -- the wh@@ inn@@ ying and the ni@@ ck@@ ering and everything -- that starts usually with one per@@ former , car@@ ries on with a second person and ends with a third .
A@@ K : M@@ ik@@ ey B@@ re@@ t@@ t from L@@ ei@@ c@@ es@@ ter@@ shi@@ re .
M@@ ik@@ ey B@@ re@@ t@@ t , Cra@@ i@@ g , Le@@ o , Z@@ em Jo@@ a@@ qu@@ in and B@@ as@@ il and me .
thank you . thank you .
H@@ and@@ spring P@@ up@@ pet C@@ o . : the geni@@ us pu@@ pp@@ etry behind War H@@ or@@ se
&quot; pu@@ pp@@ ets always have to try to be alive , &quot; says A@@ dri@@ an K@@ o@@ h@@ l@@ er of the H@@ and@@ spring P@@ up@@ pet Com@@ p@@ any , a gl@@ ori@@ ously ambi@@ ti@@ ous tr@@ ou@@ pe of human and wo@@ o@@ den ac@@ tors . beginning with the tal@@ e of a hy@@ en@@ a &apos;s sub@@ tle pa@@ w , pu@@ pp@@ et@@ e@@ ers K@@ o@@ h@@ l@@ er and B@@ as@@ il J@@ ones build to the story of their l@@ atest ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ment : the wonder@@ fully life @-@ like Jo@@ ey , the War H@@ or@@ se , who tro@@ ts convin@@ c@@ ingly onto the stage .
animals , arts , design , enter@@ tain@@ ment , theater
let &apos;s start with day and night .
life evolved under conditions of light and dar@@ k@@ ness , light and then dar@@ k@@ ness .
and so plants and animals developed their own inter@@ nal clo@@ cks so that they would be ready for these changes in light .
these are chemical clo@@ cks , and they &apos;re found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell .
I &apos;ll give you an example -- if you take a hor@@ s@@ es@@ ho@@ e cra@@ b off the be@@ ach , and you fly it all the way across the continent , and you drop it into a slo@@ ped c@@ age , it will sc@@ ra@@ m@@ ble up the floor of the c@@ age as the ti@@ de is ris@@ ing on its home shor@@ es , and it &apos;ll sk@@ it@@ ter down again right as the water is rec@@ eding thousands of miles away .
it &apos;ll do this for weeks , until it kind of gradu@@ ally los@@ es the p@@ lot .
and it &apos;s incredible to watch , but there &apos;s nothing psy@@ chi@@ c or par@@ an@@ or@@ mal going on ; it &apos;s simply that these cr@@ ab@@ s have inter@@ nal cy@@ cles that cor@@ respond , usually , with what &apos;s going on around it .
so , we have this ability as well .
and in humans , we call it the &quot; body clo@@ ck . &quot;
you can see this most clearly when you take away someone &apos;s watch and you sh@@ ut them into a b@@ unk@@ er , deep under@@ ground , for a couple of months .
people actually volunte@@ er for this , and they usually come out kind of ra@@ ving about their produc@@ tive time in the hole .
so , no matter how at@@ yp@@ ical these sub@@ jects would have to be , they all show the same thing .
they get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so -- and they kind of dri@@ ft all the way around the clo@@ ck like this over the course of the weeks .
and so , in this way we know that they are working on their own inter@@ nal clo@@ cks , rather than somehow sen@@ sing the day outside .
so fine , we have a body clo@@ ck , and it turns out that it &apos;s incredibly important in our lives .
it &apos;s a huge dri@@ ver for culture and I think that it &apos;s the most under@@ r@@ ated force on our behavior .
we evolved as a species near the equ@@ ator , and so we &apos;re very well @-@ e@@ qui@@ pped to deal with 12 hours of da@@ y@@ light and 12 hours of dar@@ k@@ ness .
but of course , we &apos;ve spread to every corner of the glo@@ be and in Ar@@ c@@ tic Canada , where I live , we have per@@ pet@@ ual da@@ y@@ light in summer and 24 hours of dar@@ k@@ ness in win@@ ter .
so the culture , the nor@@ thern abor@@ ig@@ in@@ al culture , tradi@@ tion@@ ally has been highly seas@@ on@@ al .
in win@@ ter , there &apos;s a lot of sle@@ eping going on ; you enjoy your family life inside .
and in summer , it &apos;s almost man@@ ic hun@@ ting and working activity very long hours , very active .
so , what would our natural r@@ hyth@@ m look like ?
what would our sle@@ eping patterns be in the sort of ide@@ al sense ?
well , it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all , they sleep twice every night .
they go to bed around 8 : 00 p@@ .@@ m .
until mi@@ d@@ night and then again , they sleep from about 2 : 00 a@@ .@@ m@@ . until sun@@ rise .
and in @-@ between , they have a couple of hours of sort of medi@@ ta@@ tive qu@@ iet in bed .
and during this time , there &apos;s a sur@@ ge of pro@@ l@@ ac@@ tin , the li@@ kes of which a modern day never se@@ es .
the people in these studies report feeling so a@@ wake during the da@@ y@@ time , that they realize they &apos;re experi@@ en@@ cing true wa@@ k@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness for the first time in their lives .
so , cut to the modern day .
we &apos;re living in a culture of je@@ t lag , global travel , 24 @-@ hour business , shift work .
and you know , our modern ways of doing things have their advan@@ ta@@ ges , but I believe we should understand the costs .
thank you .
J@@ ess@@ a G@@ am@@ ble : our natural sleep cycle
in today &apos;s world , bal@@ an@@ cing school , work , kids and more , most of us can only hope for the re@@ com@@ men@@ ded eight hours of sleep . exam@@ ining the science behind our body &apos;s inter@@ nal clo@@ ck , J@@ ess@@ a G@@ am@@ ble reve@@ als the surprising and sub@@ st@@ anti@@ al program of rest we should be ob@@ ser@@ ving .
I want to help you re @-@ percei@@ ve what ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y is , what it could be , and what your relationship to it is .
and in doing that , I want to offer you a vision , an imag@@ ined future , if you will , of how , as the po@@ et Se@@ am@@ us He@@ an@@ ey has put it , &quot; O@@ n@@ ce in a life@@ time the lon@@ ged @-@ for ti@@ d@@ al wave of justice can rise up , and hope and history r@@ hy@@ me . &quot;
I want to start with these word pa@@ irs here .
we all know which side of these we &apos;d like to be on .
when ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y was rein@@ v@@ ented a century ago , when the foun@@ dation form was actually invented , they didn &apos;t think of themselves on the wrong side of these either .
in fact they would never have thought of themselves as closed and set in their ways , as slow to respond to new challenges , as small and risk @-@ a@@ verse .
and in fact they weren &apos;t . they were rein@@ vent@@ ing char@@ ity in those times , what Rock@@ ef@@ eller called &quot; the business of ben@@ evol@@ ence . &quot;
but by the end of the 20th century , a new generation of cri@@ tics and re@@ form@@ ers had come to see ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y just this way .
the thing to watch for as a global ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y industry comes about -- and that &apos;s exactly what is happening -- is how the as@@ pi@@ ration is to fli@@ p these old assu@@ mp@@ tions , for ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y to become open and big and fast and connected , in service of the long term .
this entrepren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al energy is emerging from many quar@@ ters .
and it &apos;s driven and pro@@ p@@ ell@@ ed forward by new leaders , like many of the people here , by new tools , like the ones we &apos;ve seen here , and by new pres@@ sur@@ es .
I &apos;ve been following this change for quite a while now , and particip@@ ating in it .
this report is our main public report .
what it tells is the story of how today actually could be as histor@@ ic as 100 years ago .
what I want to do is share some of the cool@@ est things that are going on with you .
and as I do that , I &apos;m not going to d@@ well much on the very large ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y that everybody already knows about -- the G@@ ates or the S@@ or@@ os or the Google .
instead , what I want to do is talk about the ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y of all of us : the democra@@ ti@@ zation of ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y .
this is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time .
what I &apos;m going to do is look at five categ@@ ories of experiments , each of which challenges an old assu@@ mption of ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y .
the first is mass collabor@@ ation , repres@@ ented here by Wikipedia .
now , this may surprise you .
but remember , ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y is about giving of time and tal@@ ent , not just money .
cla@@ y Shi@@ r@@ ky , that great chron@@ ic@@ ler of everything net@@ worked , has cap@@ tured the assu@@ mption that this challenges in such a beautiful way .
he said , &quot; We have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money .
now we have Wikipedia .
suddenly big things can be done for love . &quot;
watch , this spring , for Paul Ha@@ w@@ ken &apos;s new book -- Au@@ th@@ or and entrepren@@ eur many of you may know about .
the book is called &quot; Bl@@ essed U@@ n@@ rest . &quot;
and when it comes out , a series of wi@@ k@@ i sites under the l@@ abel W@@ I@@ SE@@ R , are going to la@@ unch at the same time .
wis@@ er stands for World In@@ de@@ x for So@@ cial and En@@ vi@@ ron@@ mental Res@@ pon@@ si@@ bility .
wis@@ er s@@ ets out to docum@@ ent , link and em@@ power what Paul calls the largest movement , and fa@@ st@@ est @-@ growing movement in human history : humanity &apos;s collective imm@@ une response to today &apos;s thre@@ ats .
now , all of these big things for love -- experiments -- aren &apos;t going to take off .
but the ones that do are going to be the biggest , the most open , the fa@@ st@@ est , the most connected form of ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y in human history .
second categ@@ ory is online ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y mark@@ et@@ places .
this is , of course , to ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y what e@@ Bay and Ama@@ zon are to commer@@ ce .
think of it as pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y .
and this challenges yet another assu@@ mption , which is that organized ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y is only for the very we@@ al@@ thy .
take a look , if you haven &apos;t , at Don@@ or@@ s@@ C@@ ho@@ ose .
O@@ mi@@ dy@@ ar Net@@ work has made a big investment in Don@@ or@@ s@@ C@@ ho@@ ose .
it &apos;s one of the best known of these new mark@@ et@@ places where a don@@ or can go straight into a classroom and connect with what a teacher says they need .
take a look at Ch@@ an@@ ging the Pres@@ ent , started by a TED@@ ster , next time you need a we@@ d@@ ding present or a ho@@ li@@ day present .
Gi@@ ve@@ India is for a whole country .
and it goes on and on .
the third categ@@ ory is repres@@ ented by War@@ ren Bu@@ ff@@ et , which I call ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated giving .
it &apos;s not just that War@@ ren Bu@@ ff@@ et was so ama@@ z@@ ingly gener@@ ous in that histor@@ ic act last summer .
it &apos;s that he ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ed another assu@@ mption , that every gi@@ ver should have his or her own f@@ und or foun@@ dation .
there are now , today , so many new fun@@ ds that are ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ating giving and inves@@ ting , bringing together people around a common goal , to think bigger .
one of the best known is A@@ cu@@ men F@@ und , led by J@@ acqu@@ eline No@@ vo@@ gr@@ at@@ z , a TED@@ ster who got a big bo@@ ost here at TED .
but there are many others : new Pro@@ f@@ it in Cambridge , New School &apos;s V@@ ent@@ ure F@@ und in S@@ ili@@ con Valley , V@@ ent@@ ure Ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y Par@@ t@@ ners in Washington , Global F@@ und for W@@ om@@ en in San Francisco .
take a look at these .
these fun@@ ds are to ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y what vent@@ ure capital , private equ@@ ity , and eventually mu@@ tual fun@@ ds are to inves@@ ting , but with a tw@@ ist -- because often a community forms around these fun@@ ds , as it has at A@@ cu@@ men and other places .
now , imagine for a second these first three types of experiments : mass collabor@@ ation , online mark@@ et@@ places , ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated giving .
and understand how they help us re @-@ percei@@ ve what organized ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y is .
it &apos;s not about foun@@ da@@ tions necessarily ; it &apos;s about the rest of us .
I &apos;m going to look quickly at the fourth and fif@@ th categ@@ ories , which are innovation , competi@@ tions and social inves@@ ting .
they &apos;re be@@ tting a v@@ isible competition , a pri@@ ze , can attra@@ ct tal@@ ent and money to some of the most difficult issues , and ther@@ e@@ by speed the solution .
this tac@@ kl@@ es yet another assu@@ mption , that the gi@@ ver and the organization is at the center , as op@@ posed to putting the problem at the center .
you can look to these innov@@ ators to help us especially with things that requ@@ ire technologi@@ cal or scientific solution .
that leaves the final categ@@ ory , social inves@@ ting , which is really , anyway , the biggest of them all , repres@@ ented here by X@@ i@@ gi@@ .@@ net .
and this , of course , tac@@ kl@@ es the biggest assu@@ mption of all , that business is business , and ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world .
X@@ ig@@ i is a new community site that &apos;s built by the community , lin@@ king and m@@ apping this new social capital market .
it lis@@ ts already 1,000 enti@@ ties that are off@@ ering de@@ bt and equ@@ ity for social enter@@ pr@@ ise .
so we can look to these innov@@ ators to help us remember that if we can le@@ verage even a small amount of the capital that se@@ e@@ ks a return , the good that can be driven could be ast@@ on@@ ishing .
now , what &apos;s really interesting here is that we &apos;re not thinking our way into a new way of acting ; we &apos;re acting our way into a new way of thinking .
ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y is re@@ organi@@ zing itself before our very eyes .
and even though all of the experiments and all of the big gi@@ vers don &apos;t yet f@@ ul@@ fill this as@@ pi@@ ration , I think this is the new z@@ ei@@ t@@ g@@ ei@@ st : open , big , fast , connected , and , let us also hope , long .
we have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things .
if we don &apos;t develop the st@@ am@@ ina to stick with things -- whatever it is you pick , stick with it -- all of this stuff is just going to be , you know , a fa@@ d .
but I &apos;m really hop@@ eful .
and I &apos;m hop@@ eful because it &apos;s not only ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y that &apos;s re@@ organi@@ zing itself , it &apos;s also whole other por@@ tions of the social sector , and of business , that are bus@@ y challen@@ ging &quot; business as usual . &quot;
and everywhere I go , including here at TED , I feel that there is a new moral h@@ unger that is growing .
what we &apos;re seeing is people really w@@ res@@ t@@ ling to describe what is this new thing that &apos;s happening .
words like &quot; ph@@ il@@ an@@ thro@@ capit@@ alism , &quot; and &quot; natural capit@@ alism , &quot; and &quot; ph@@ il@@ an@@ thro@@ entrepren@@ eur , &quot; and &quot; vent@@ ure ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y . &quot;
we don &apos;t have a language for it yet .
whatever we call it , it &apos;s new , it &apos;s beginning , and I think it &apos;s g@@ ong to quite significant .
and that &apos;s where my imag@@ ined future comes in , which I am going to call the social sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity .
many of you will realize that I &apos;m ri@@ pping a bit off of the science fic@@ tion writer Ver@@ n@@ or V@@ in@@ ge &apos;s notion of a technologi@@ cal sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity , where a number of tr@@ ends acceler@@ ate and conver@@ ge and come together to create , really , a sho@@ ck@@ ingly new reality .
it may be that the social sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity ahead is the one that we fear the most : a conver@@ gence of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es , of environmental de@@ gra@@ dation , of weapons of mass destru@@ ction , of pan@@ de@@ mi@@ cs , of poverty .
that &apos;s because our ability to con@@ front the problems that we face has not kept p@@ ace with our ability to create them .
and as we &apos;ve heard here , it is no ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation to say that we hold the future of our civilization in our hands as never before .
the question is , is there a positive social sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity ?
is there a fron@@ tier for us of how we live together ?
our future doesn &apos;t have to be imag@@ ined .
we can create a future where hope and history r@@ hy@@ me .
but we have a problem .
our experience to date , both individu@@ ally and colle@@ c@@ tively , hasn &apos;t prepar@@ ed us for what we &apos;re going to need to do , or who we &apos;re going to need to be .
we are going to need a new generation of citi@@ zen leaders willing to com@@ mit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapi@@ dly as possible .
that &apos;s why I have one last thing I want to show you .
this is a photograph taken about 100 years ago of my grand@@ father and great @-@ grand@@ father .
this is a newsp@@ aper publ@@ is@@ her and a ban@@ ker .
and they were great community leaders .
and , yes , they were great ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ ists .
I keep this photograph close by to me -- it &apos;s in my office -- because I &apos;ve always felt a my@@ sti@@ cal connection to these two men , both of whom I never knew .
and so , in their hon@@ or , I want to offer you this bl@@ ank slide .
and I want you to imagine that this a photograph of you .
and I want you to think about the community that you want to be part of creating .
whatever that means to you .
and I want you to imagine that it &apos;s 100 years from now , and your grand@@ child , or great @-@ grand@@ child , or ni@@ e@@ ce or ne@@ ph@@ e@@ w or go@@ d @-@ child , is looking at this photograph of you .
what is the story you most want for them to tell ?
thank you very much .
Ka@@ ther@@ ine F@@ ul@@ ton : you are the future of ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y
in this up@@ li@@ f@@ ting talk , Ka@@ ther@@ ine F@@ ul@@ ton sk@@ et@@ ches the new future of ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y -- one where collabor@@ ation and innovation allow regular people to do big things , even when money is scar@@ ce . giving five practical examples of crow@@ d @-@ driven ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ y , she calls for a new generation of citi@@ zen leaders .
I believe that there are new , hidden ten@@ sions that are actually happening between people and institutions -- institutions that are the institutions that people in@@ hab@@ it in their daily life : schools , hospit@@ als , work@@ places , fact@@ ories , off@@ ices , etc .
and something that I see happening is something that I would like to call a sort of &quot; democra@@ ti@@ zation of in@@ ti@@ ma@@ cy . &quot;
and what do I mean by that ?
I mean that what people are doing is , in fact , they are sort of , with their communication chan@@ n@@ els , they are brea@@ king an im@@ posed is@@ ol@@ ation that these institutions are im@@ pos@@ ing on them .
how are they doing this ? they &apos;re doing it in a very simple way , by call@@ ing their mom from work , by I@@ M@@ ing from their office to their friends , by tex@@ ting under the des@@ k .
the pictures that you &apos;re seeing behind me are people that I vis@@ ited in the last few months .
and I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most .
and somebody brought a bo@@ y@@ friend , somebody a father .
one young woman brought her grand@@ father .
for 20 years , I &apos;ve been looking at how people use chan@@ n@@ els such as email , the mobile phone , tex@@ ting , etc .
what we &apos;re actually going to see is that , fundament@@ ally , people are communic@@ ating on a regular basis with five , six , seven of their most in@@ ti@@ mate sp@@ here .
now , lets take some data . Facebook .
recently some soci@@ ologists from Facebook -- Facebook is the chan@@ nel that you would expect is the most en@@ lar@@ gen@@ ing of all chan@@ n@@ els .
and an average user , said C@@ amer@@ on Mar@@ low , from Facebook , has about 120 friends .
but he actually talks to , has two @-@ way ex@@ changes with , about four to six people on a regular base , depen@@ ding on his gender .
acade@@ mic research on inst@@ ant mes@@ sa@@ ging also shows 100 people on bu@@ d@@ dy lis@@ ts , but fundament@@ ally people ch@@ at with two , three , four -- anyway , less than five .
my own research on cell@@ phones and voice calls shows that 80 percent of the calls are actually made to four people . 80 percent .
and when you go to Sk@@ ype , it &apos;s down to two people .
a lot of soci@@ ologists actually are quite dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted .
I mean , I &apos;ve been a bit dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted sometimes when I saw this data and all this dep@@ lo@@ y@@ ment , just for five people .
and some soci@@ ologists actually feel that it &apos;s a clos@@ ure , it &apos;s a co@@ co@@ on@@ ing , that we &apos;re dis@@ eng@@ aging from the public .
and I would actually , I would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it , and from where they &apos;re doing it , actually there is an incredible social transformation .
there are three stories that I think are quite good examples .
the first gentle@@ man , he &apos;s a b@@ ak@@ er .
and so he starts working every morning at four o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck in the morning .
and around eight o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck he sort of s@@ ne@@ a@@ ks away from his o@@ ven , cle@@ ans his hands from the fl@@ our and calls his wife .
he just wants to wish her a good day , because that &apos;s the start of her day .
and I &apos;ve heard this story a number of times .
a young factory wor@@ ker who works night shif@@ ts , who man@@ ages to s@@ ne@@ ak away from the factory floor , where there is C@@ C@@ TV by the way , and find a corner , where at 11 o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck at night he can call his gir@@ l@@ friend and just say go@@ od@@ night .
or a mother who , at four o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck , suddenly man@@ ages to find a corner in the toi@@ let to check that her children are saf@@ ely home .
then there is another couple , there is a Brazi@@ li@@ an couple .
they &apos;ve lived in Ital@@ y for a number of years .
they Sk@@ ype with their families a few times a week .
but once a for@@ t@@ night , they actually put the computer on their d@@ ining table , pull out the we@@ b@@ c@@ am and actually have dinner with their family in Sa@@ o P@@ au@@ l@@ o . and they have a big event of it .
and I heard this story the first time a couple of years ago from a very mo@@ dest family of imm@@ ig@@ rants from K@@ os@@ ov@@ o in S@@ wi@@ tz@@ er@@ land .
they had set up a big screen in their living room , and every morning they had break@@ fast with their grandmother .
but Dan@@ ny M@@ ill@@ er , who is a very good anthrop@@ ologist who is working on F@@ ili@@ p@@ ina mig@@ r@@ ant women who leave their children back in the Phili@@ pp@@ ines , was telling me about how much par@@ enting is going on through Sk@@ ype , and how much these mothers are eng@@ aged with their children through Sk@@ ype .
and then there is the third couple . they are two friends .
they ch@@ at to each other every day , a few times a day actually .
and finally , finally , they &apos;ve managed to put inst@@ ant mes@@ sa@@ ging on their computers at work .
and now , obviously , they have it open .
whenever they have a moment they ch@@ at to each other .
and this is exactly what we &apos;ve been seeing with teen@@ agers and kids doing it in school , under the table , and tex@@ ting under the table to their friends .
so , none of these cases are unique .
I mean , I could tell you hundreds of them .
but what is really exc@@ ep@@ tional is the setting .
so , think of the three sett@@ ings I &apos;ve talked to you about : factory , mig@@ ration , office .
but it could be in a school , it could be an ad@@ minis@@ tra@@ tion , it could be a hospital .
three sett@@ ings that , if we just step back 15 years , if you just think back 15 years , when you clo@@ cked in , when you clo@@ cked in to an office , when you clo@@ cked in to a factory , there was no contact for the whole dur@@ ation of the time , there was no contact with your private sp@@ here .
if you were lucky there was a public phone han@@ ging in the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or or somewhere .
if you were in management , oh , that was a different story .
maybe you had a direct line .
if you were not , you maybe had to go through an oper@@ ator .
but basically , when you walked into those buildings , the private sp@@ here was left behind you .
and this has become such a nor@@ m of our professional lives , such a nor@@ m and such an expec@@ tation .
and it had nothing to do with technical cap@@ ability .
the phones were there . but the expec@@ tation was once you moved in there your commit@@ ment was fully to the task at hand , fully to the people around you .
that was where the focus had to be .
and this has become such a cultural nor@@ m that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this c@@ lea@@ v@@ age .
if you think nur@@ ser@@ y , kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , first years of school are just de@@ dic@@ ated to take away the children , to make them used to sta@@ ying long hours away from their family .
and then the school en@@ acts perfectly well .
it m@@ im@@ ics perfectly all the ri@@ tu@@ als that we will find in off@@ ices : ri@@ tu@@ als of ent@@ ry , ri@@ tu@@ als of ex@@ it , the sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ es , the uni@@ forms in this country , things that identi@@ fy you , team @-@ building ac@@ tivi@@ ties , team building that will allow you to basically be with a random group of kids , or a random group of people that you will have to be with for a number of time .
and of course , the major thing : learn to pay attention , to concent@@ rate and focus your attention .
this only started about 150 years ago .
it only started with the birth of modern bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy , and of industrial revolution .
when people basically had to go somewhere else to work and carry out the work .
and when with modern bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy there was a very rational approach , where there was a clear distin@@ ction between the private sp@@ here and the public sp@@ here .
so , until then , basically people were living on top of their tra@@ des .
they were living on top of the land they were labor@@ ing .
they were living on top of the work@@ sh@@ ops where they were working .
and if you think , it &apos;s per@@ me@@ ated our whole culture , even our cities .
if you think of medi@@ ev@@ al cities , medi@@ ev@@ al cities the bor@@ ough@@ s all have the names of the gu@@ il@@ ds and profes@@ sions that lived there .
now we have spra@@ w@@ ling res@@ identi@@ al sub@@ ur@@ bi@@ as that are well distin@@ ct from production areas and commercial areas .
and actually , over these 150 years , there has been a very clear class system that also has emerg@@ ed .
so the lower the status of the job and of the person car@@ rying out , the more re@@ moved he would be from his personal sp@@ here .
people have taken this amazing possibility of actually being in contact all through the day or in all types of situ@@ ations .
and they are doing it mas@@ si@@ vely .
the Pe@@ w Institute , which produ@@ ces good data on a regular basis on , for instance , in the States , says that -- and I think that this number is conserv@@ ative -- 50 percent of anybody with email access at work is actually doing private email from his office .
I really think that the number is conserv@@ ative .
in my own research , we saw that the pe@@ ak for private email is actually 11 o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck in the morning , whatever the country .
75 percent of people ad@@ mit doing private conver@@ sa@@ tions from work on their mobile phones .
100 percent are using text .
the point is that this re @-@ appropri@@ ation of the personal sp@@ here is not terri@@ bly successful with all institutions .
I &apos;m always surprised the U.S. Ar@@ my soci@@ ologists are discus@@ sing of the impact for instance , of soldiers in Iraq having daily contact with their families .
but there are many institutions that are actually blo@@ cking this access .
and every day , every single day , I read news that makes me c@@ rin@@ ge , like a $ 15 fine to kids in Texas , for using , every time they take out their mobile phone in school .
immedi@@ ate dis@@ mis@@ s@@ al to bus dri@@ vers in New York , if seen with a mobile phone in a hand .
companies blo@@ cking access to I@@ M or to Facebook .
behind issues of security and saf@@ ety , which have always been the argum@@ ents for social control , in fact what is going on is that these institutions are trying to decide who , in fact , has a right to self deter@@ mine their attention , to decide , whether they should , or not , be is@@ ol@@ ated .
and they are actually trying to block , in a certain sense , this movement of a greater possibility of in@@ ti@@ ma@@ cy .
Ste@@ fan@@ a Bro@@ ad@@ b@@ ent : how the Internet en@@ ables in@@ ti@@ ma@@ cy
we worry that I@@ M , tex@@ ting , Facebook are spo@@ iling human in@@ ti@@ ma@@ cy , but Ste@@ fan@@ a Bro@@ ad@@ b@@ ent &apos;s research shows how communication tech is capable of cul@@ tiv@@ ating deep@@ er relationships , bringing love across bar@@ ri@@ ers like distance and work@@ place rules .
so , how many of you have ever gotten behind the whe@@ el of a car when you really shouldn &apos;t have been driving ?
maybe you &apos;re out on the road for a long day , and you just wanted to get home .
you were ti@@ red , but you felt you could drive a few more miles .
maybe you thought , I &apos;ve had less to dr@@ ink than everybody else , I should be the one to go home .
or maybe your mind was just entirely el@@ se@@ where .
does this sound familiar to you ?
now , in those situ@@ ations , wouldn &apos;t it be great if there was a bu@@ tt@@ on on your d@@ ash@@ board that you could push , and the car would get you home saf@@ ely ?
now , that &apos;s been the promise of the self @-@ driving car , the auton@@ om@@ ous vehicle , and it &apos;s been the dream since at least 19@@ 3@@ 9 , when General M@@ ot@@ ors sho@@ w@@ c@@ as@@ ed this idea at their F@@ u@@ tur@@ ama bo@@ oth at the World &apos;s F@@ air .
now , it &apos;s been one of those dreams that &apos;s always seemed about 20 years in the future .
now , two weeks ago , that dream took a step forward , when the state of N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a gran@@ ted Google &apos;s self @-@ driving car the very first lic@@ en@@ se for an auton@@ om@@ ous vehicle , clearly establ@@ ishing that it &apos;s legal for them to test it on the ro@@ ads in N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a .
now , California &apos;s consi@@ der@@ ing similar leg@@ is@@ l@@ ation , and this would make sure that the auton@@ om@@ ous car is not one of those things that has to stay in V@@ eg@@ as .
now , in my lab at Stanford , we &apos;ve been working on auton@@ om@@ ous cars too , but with a slightly different sp@@ in on things . you see , we &apos;ve been developing robo@@ tic race cars , cars that can actually push themselves to the very limit@@ s of physical performance .
now , why would we want to do such a thing ?
well , there &apos;s two really good reasons for this .
first , we believe that before people turn over control to an auton@@ om@@ ous car , that auton@@ om@@ ous car should be at least as good as the very best human dri@@ vers .
now , if you &apos;re like me , and the other 70 percent of the population who know that we are above @-@ average dri@@ vers , you understand that &apos;s a very high bar .
there &apos;s another reason as well .
just like race car dri@@ vers can use all of the fri@@ ction between the ti@@ re and the road , all of the car &apos;s cap@@ abilities to go as fast as possible , we want to use all of those cap@@ abilities to avoid any accident we can .
now , you may push the car to the limit@@ s not because you &apos;re driving too fast , but because you &apos;ve hit an ic@@ y pat@@ ch of road , conditions have changed .
in those situ@@ ations , we want a car that is capable enough to avoid any accident that can physi@@ cally be a@@ vo@@ i@@ ded .
I must conf@@ ess , there &apos;s kind of a third motiv@@ ation as well .
you see , I have a passion for ra@@ cing .
in the past , I &apos;ve been a race car ow@@ ner , a cre@@ w ch@@ ief and a driving co@@ ach , although maybe not at the level that you &apos;re currently expe@@ cting .
one of the things that we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehic@@ les -- is what we believe is the world &apos;s first auton@@ om@@ ously dri@@ f@@ ting car .
it &apos;s another one of those categ@@ ories where maybe there &apos;s not a lot of competition .
but this is P@@ 1 . it &apos;s an entirely student @-@ built electric vehicle , which through using its re@@ ar @-@ whe@@ el drive and front @-@ whe@@ el ste@@ er @-@ by @-@ wire can dri@@ ft around cor@@ ners .
it can get si@@ de@@ ways like a r@@ ally car dri@@ ver , always able to take the ti@@ gh@@ test cur@@ ve , even on sli@@ p@@ per@@ y , changing sur@@ faces , never sp@@ inning out .
we &apos;ve also worked with V@@ ol@@ k@@ s@@ wa@@ gen O@@ ra@@ cle , on S@@ hel@@ ley , an auton@@ om@@ ous race car that has ra@@ ced at 150 miles an hour through the Bon@@ ne@@ ville S@@ alt F@@ l@@ ats , gone around Th@@ under@@ h@@ ill R@@ ace@@ way Park in the sun , the wind and the rain , and na@@ vi@@ g@@ ated the 15@@ 3 turns and 12@@ .@@ 4 miles of the Pi@@ kes P@@ ea@@ k H@@ ill C@@ lim@@ b rou@@ te in Col@@ or@@ a@@ do with nobody at the whe@@ el .
I guess it goes without saying that we &apos;ve had a lot of fun doing this .
but in fact , there &apos;s something else that we &apos;ve developed in the process of developing these auton@@ om@@ ous cars .
we have developed a tremendous appreci@@ ation for the cap@@ abilities of human race car dri@@ vers .
as we &apos;ve looked at the question of how well do these cars per@@ form , we wanted to compare them to our human counter@@ parts .
and we discovered their human counter@@ parts are amazing .
now , we can take a map of a race track , we can take a mathematical model of a car , and with some i@@ ter@@ ation , we can actually find the fa@@ st@@ est way around that track .
we line that up with data that we record from a professional dri@@ ver , and the res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance is absolutely remarkable .
yes , there are sub@@ tle differences here , but the human race car dri@@ ver is able to go out and drive an ama@@ z@@ ingly fast line , without the benefit of an algorith@@ m that compar@@ es the trade @-@ off between going as fast as possible in this corner , and s@@ having a little bit of time off of the straight over here .
not only that , they &apos;re able to do it la@@ p after la@@ p after la@@ p .
they &apos;re able to go out and cons@@ ist@@ ently do this , push@@ ing the car to the limit@@ s every single time .
it &apos;s extraordinary to watch .
you put them in a new car , and after a few l@@ aps , they &apos;ve found the fa@@ st@@ est line in that car , and they &apos;re off to the ra@@ ces .
it really makes you think , we &apos;d love to know what &apos;s going on inside their brain .
so as researchers , that &apos;s what we decided to find out .
we decided to instrument not only the car , but also the race car dri@@ ver , to try to get a gli@@ mp@@ se into what was going on in their head as they were doing this .
now , this is Dr. L@@ ene Har@@ bot@@ t ap@@ pl@@ ying electro@@ des to the head of John Mor@@ ton .
John Mor@@ ton is a former C@@ an @-@ A@@ m and I@@ M@@ S@@ A dri@@ ver , who &apos;s also a class ch@@ amp@@ i@@ on at L@@ e M@@ ans .
fantastic dri@@ ver , and very willing to put up with graduate students and this sort of research .
she &apos;s putting electro@@ des on his head so that we can monit@@ or the electrical activity in John &apos;s brain as he ra@@ ces around the track .
now , clearly we &apos;re not going to put a couple of electro@@ des on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track .
however , neuros@@ ci@@ enti@@ sts have identi@@ fied certain patterns that let us te@@ ase out some very important as@@ pe@@ cts of this .
for instance , the res@@ ting brain ten@@ ds to generate a lot of al@@ ph@@ a waves .
in contr@@ ast , th@@ et@@ a waves are associated with a lot of cognitive activity , like visual process@@ ing , things where the dri@@ ver is thinking quite a bit .
now , we can measure this , and we can look at the relative power between the th@@ et@@ a waves and the al@@ ph@@ a waves .
this gives us a measure of mental work@@ load , how much the dri@@ ver is actually ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ed c@@ og@@ ni@@ tively at any point along the track .
now , we wanted to see if we could actually record this on the track , so we head@@ ed down s@@ outh to L@@ ag@@ un@@ a S@@ ec@@ a .
L@@ ag@@ un@@ a S@@ ec@@ a is a le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y ra@@ ce@@ way about hal@@ f@@ way between Sal@@ in@@ as and Mon@@ ter@@ ey .
it has a cur@@ ve there called the Cor@@ k@@ scre@@ w .
now , the Cor@@ k@@ scre@@ w is a ch@@ ic@@ ane , followed by a quick right @-@ hand@@ ed turn as the road d@@ rop@@ s three stories .
now , the strategy for driving this as expla@@ ined to me was , you a@@ im for the bus@@ h in the distance , and as the road falls away , you realize it was actually the top of a tree .
all right , so thanks to the R@@ ev@@ s Pro@@ gra@@ m at Stanford , we were able to take John there and put him behind the whe@@ el of a 1960 Por@@ sch@@ e A@@ bar@@ th Car@@ r@@ era .
life is way too short for bor@@ ing cars .
so , here you see John on the track , he &apos;s going up the h@@ ill -- Oh ! somebody liked that -- and you can see , actually , his mental work@@ load -- meas@@ uring here in the red bar -- you can see his actions as he approach@@ es .
now watch , he has to down@@ shift .
and then he has to turn left .
look for the tree , and down .
not surpris@@ ingly , you can see this is a pretty challen@@ ging task .
you can see his mental work@@ load spi@@ ke as he goes through this , as you would expect with something that requ@@ ires this level of complexity .
but what &apos;s really interesting is to look at areas of the track where his mental work@@ load doesn &apos;t increase .
I &apos;m going to take you around now to the other side of the track .
turn three . and John &apos;s going to go into that corner and the re@@ ar end of the car is going to begin to slide out .
he &apos;s going to have to cor@@ rect for that with ste@@ ering .
so watch as John does this here .
watch the mental work@@ load , and watch the ste@@ ering .
the car begins to slide out , drama@@ tic man@@ eu@@ ver to cor@@ rect it , and no change what@@ so@@ ever in the mental work@@ load .
not a challen@@ ging task .
in fact , entirely refle@@ xi@@ ve .
now , our data process@@ ing on this is still pr@@ elimin@@ ary , but it really seems that these phenomen@@ al fe@@ ats that the race car dri@@ vers are per@@ forming are inst@@ in@@ ctive .
they are things that they have simply learned to do .
it requ@@ ires very little mental work@@ load for them to per@@ form these amazing fe@@ ats .
and their actions are fantastic .
this is exactly what you want to do on the ste@@ ering whe@@ el to catch the car in this situation .
now , this has given us tremendous in@@ sight and inspi@@ ration for our own auton@@ om@@ ous vehic@@ les .
we &apos;ve started to ask the question : can we make them a little less algorith@@ mic and a little more intui@@ tive ?
can we take this refle@@ xi@@ ve action that we see from the very best race car dri@@ vers , introdu@@ ce it to our cars , and maybe even into a system that could get onto your car in the future ?
that would take us a long step along the road to auton@@ om@@ ous vehic@@ les that drive as well as the best humans .
but it &apos;s made us think a little bit more deeply as well .
do we want something more from our car than to simply be a ch@@ au@@ ff@@ eur ?
do we want our car to perhaps be a partner , a co@@ ach , someone that can use their understanding of the situation to help us reach our potential ?
can , in fact , the technology not simply re@@ place humans , but allow us to reach the level of refle@@ x and intu@@ ition that we &apos;re all capable of ?
so , as we move forward into this technologi@@ cal future , I want you to just p@@ ause and think of that for a moment .
what is the ide@@ al balance of human and machine ?
and as we think about that , let &apos;s take inspi@@ ration from the absolutely amazing cap@@ abilities of the human body and the human mind .
thank you .
Chris Ger@@ des : the future race car -- 15@@ 0@@ mp@@ h , and no dri@@ ver
so today , I &apos;m going to tell you about some people who didn &apos;t move out of their neighbor@@ ho@@ ods .
the first one is happening right here in Chicago .
B@@ ren@@ da Pal@@ ms @-@ F@@ ar@@ ber was hi@@ red to help e@@ x @-@ con@@ vi@@ cts re@@ enter society and keep them from going back into prison .
currently , ta@@ x@@ pa@@ yers spend about 6@@ 0,000 dollars per year sen@@ ding a person to ja@@ il .
we know that two @-@ thir@@ ds of them are going to go back .
I find it interesting that , for every one dollar we spend , however , on early childhood education , like H@@ ead St@@ art , we save 17 dollars on stuff like in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in the future .
or -- think about it -- that 6@@ 0,000 dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to Harvard as well .
but B@@ ren@@ da , not being ph@@ as@@ ed by stuff like that , took a look at her challenge and came up with a not @-@ so @-@ obvious solution : create a business that produ@@ ces skin care products from hon@@ ey .
okay , it might be obvious to some of you ; it wasn &apos;t to me .
it &apos;s the basis of growing a form of social innovation that has real potential .
she hi@@ red se@@ em@@ ingly un@@ emplo@@ y@@ able men and women to care for the bees , har@@ v@@ est the hon@@ ey and make value @-@ ad@@ ded products that they mark@@ et@@ ed themselves , and that were later sold at W@@ hole Fo@@ ods .
she combin@@ ed emplo@@ y@@ ment experience and training with life skills they needed , like an@@ ger @-@ management and te@@ am@@ work , and also how to talk to future emplo@@ yers about how their experiences actually demon@@ str@@ ated the lessons that they had learned and their e@@ ag@@ ern@@ ess to learn more .
less than four percent actually go back to ja@@ il .
so these young men and women learned job @-@ re@@ ad@@ iness and life skills through be@@ e keeping and became produc@@ tive citizens in the process .
talk about a swe@@ et beginning .
now , I &apos;m going to take you to Los Angeles , and lots of people know that L@@ .@@ A@@ . has its issues .
but I &apos;m going to talk about L@@ .@@ A@@ . &apos; s water issues right now .
they have not enough water on most days and too much to hand@@ le when it ra@@ ins .
currently , 20 percent of California &apos;s energy consumption is used to p@@ ump water into mostly S@@ ou@@ thern California .
their spending lo@@ ads , lo@@ ads , to chan@@ nel that rain@@ water out into the ocean when it ra@@ ins and f@@ loo@@ ds as well .
now An@@ dy Li@@ p@@ k@@ is is working to help L@@ .@@ A@@ . cut infrastructure costs associated with water management and urban heat island -- lin@@ king trees , people and technology to create a more li@@ vable city .
all that green stuff actually natur@@ ally absor@@ bs stor@@ m water , also helps cool our cities .
because , come to think about it , do you really want air @-@ condi@@ tioning , or is it a cool@@ er room that you want ?
how you get it shouldn &apos;t make that much of a difference .
so a few years ago , L@@ .@@ A@@ . Coun@@ ty decided that they needed to spend 2.@@ 5 billion dollars to re@@ pair the city schools .
and An@@ dy and his team discovered that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars on as@@ p@@ hal@@ t to surro@@ und the schools themselves .
and by pres@@ enting a really strong economic case , they convin@@ ced the L@@ .@@ A@@ . government that re@@ plac@@ ing that as@@ p@@ hal@@ t with trees and other green@@ ery , that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy than they spend on hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural infrastructure .
so ultimately , 20 million square feet of as@@ p@@ hal@@ t was re@@ placed or a@@ vo@@ i@@ ded , and electrical consumption for air @-@ condi@@ tioning went down , while emplo@@ y@@ ment for people to main@@ tain those gro@@ unds went up , res@@ ul@@ ting in a net @-@ sa@@ v@@ ings to the system , but also health@@ ier students and schools system employe@@ es as well .
now Ju@@ dy Bon@@ ds is a coal min@@ er &apos;s daughter .
her family has eight generations in a town called W@@ hit@@ es@@ ville , West Vir@@ gin@@ ia .
and if anyone should be cl@@ inging to the former gl@@ ory of the coal min@@ ing history , and of the town , it should be Ju@@ dy .
but the way coal is min@@ ed right now is different from the deep min@@ es that her father and her father &apos;s father would go down into and that emplo@@ yed essentially thousands and thousands of people .
now , two do@@ zen men can te@@ ar down a mountain in several months , and only for about a few years &apos; worth of coal .
that kind of technology is called &quot; moun@@ tain@@ top re@@ mov@@ al . &quot;
it can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months .
just imagine that the air surro@@ unding these places -- it &apos;s filled with the res@@ i@@ due of expl@@ osi@@ ves and coal .
when we vis@@ ited , it gave some of the people we were with this strange little c@@ ough after being only there for just a few hours or so -- not just min@@ ers , but everybody .
and Ju@@ dy saw her landscape being destro@@ yed and her water po@@ is@@ oned .
and the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emp@@ ti@@ ed , leaving even more un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment in their wake .
but she also saw the difference in potential wind energy on an in@@ t@@ act mountain , and one that was reduc@@ ed in el@@ ev@@ ation by over 2,000 feet .
three years of di@@ r@@ ty energy with not many jobs , or cent@@ u@@ ries of clean energy with the potential for developing exper@@ ti@@ se and impro@@ v@@ ements in effici@@ ency based on technical skills , and developing local knowledge about how to get the most out of that region &apos;s wind .
she calcul@@ ated the up @-@ front cost and the pa@@ y@@ back over time , and it &apos;s a net @-@ plus on so many levels for the local , national and global economy .
it &apos;s a longer pa@@ y@@ back than moun@@ tain@@ top re@@ mov@@ al , but the wind energy actually pa@@ ys back forever .
now moun@@ tain@@ top re@@ mov@@ al pa@@ ys very little money to the loc@@ als , and it gives them a lot of mis@@ ery .
the water is turned into go@@ o .
most people are still un@@ emplo@@ yed , leading to most of the same kinds of social problems that un@@ emplo@@ yed people in inner cities also experience -- drug and al@@ co@@ ho@@ l ab@@ use , dom@@ es@@ tic ab@@ use , te@@ en pre@@ g@@ nan@@ cy and poor he@@ ath , as well .
now Ju@@ dy and I -- I have to say -- totally related to each other .
not quite an obvious al@@ li@@ ance .
I mean , literally , her hom@@ et@@ own is called W@@ hit@@ es@@ ville , West Vir@@ gin@@ ia .
I mean , they are not -- they ain &apos;t comp@@ eting for the bir@@ th@@ place of hi@@ p ho@@ p ti@@ tle or anything like that .
but the back of my T @-@ shi@@ rt , the one that she gave me , says , &quot; Sa@@ ve the en@@ danger@@ ed h@@ ill@@ b@@ illi@@ es . &quot;
so hom@@ e@@ girls and h@@ ill@@ b@@ illi@@ es we got it together and totally understand that this is what it &apos;s all about .
but just a few months ago , Ju@@ dy was diagnos@@ ed with stage @-@ three lung cancer .
yeah .
and it has since moved to her b@@ ones and her brain .
and I just find it so bizar@@ re that she &apos;s suffering from the same thing that she tried so hard to protect people from .
but her dream of Co@@ al Ri@@ ver Mo@@ un@@ tain W@@ ind is her leg@@ acy .
and she might not get to see that moun@@ tain@@ top .
but rather than writing yet some kind of mani@@ fes@@ to or something , she &apos;s leaving behind a business plan to make it happen .
that &apos;s what my hom@@ e@@ girl is doing .
so I &apos;m so proud of that .
but these three people don &apos;t know each other , but they do have an awful lot in common .
they &apos;re all problem sol@@ vers , and they &apos;re just some of the many examples that I really am privi@@ le@@ ged to see , meet and learn from in the examples of the work that I do now .
I was really lucky to have them all fe@@ at@@ ured on my Cor@@ por@@ ation for P@@ u@@ bli@@ c Ra@@ di@@ o radio show called The@@ Pro@@ mis@@ ed@@ L@@ and@@ .@@ or@@ g .
now they &apos;re all very practical v@@ isi@@ on@@ aries .
they take a look at the dem@@ ands that are out there -- beauty products , healthy schools , electricity -- and how the money &apos;s flo@@ wing to meet those dem@@ ands .
and when the che@@ ap@@ est solutions invol@@ ve reduc@@ ing the number of jobs , you &apos;re left with un@@ emplo@@ yed people , and those people aren &apos;t cheap .
in fact , they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens , and they inclu@@ de gener@@ a@@ tion@@ ally im@@ po@@ ver@@ ished , trau@@ ma@@ ti@@ zed v@@ ets re@@ turning from the Middle East , people coming out of ja@@ il .
and for the ve@@ ter@@ ans in particular , the V@@ .@@ A@@ . said there &apos;s a six @-@ fold increase in mental health ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ c@@ eu@@ tic@@ als by v@@ ets since 2003 .
I think that number &apos;s probably going to go up .
they &apos;re not the largest number of people , but they are some of the most expensive -- and in terms of the lik@@ el@@ i@@ hood for dom@@ es@@ tic ab@@ use , drug and al@@ co@@ ho@@ l ab@@ use , poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stres@@ s .
so these three guys all understand how to produc@@ tively chan@@ nel dollars through our local econom@@ ies to meet exis@@ ting market dem@@ ands , reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future .
and there are pl@@ enty of other examples like that .
one problem : waste hand@@ ling and un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment .
even when we think or talk about recy@@ cl@@ ing , lots of recy@@ cl@@ able stuff ends up getting in@@ cin@@ er@@ ated or in land@@ f@@ ills and leaving many m@@ uni@@ ci@@ p@@ ali@@ ties , di@@ version rates -- they leave much to be recy@@ cl@@ ed .
and where is this waste hand@@ led ? usually in poor communities .
and we know that ec@@ o @-@ industrial business , these kinds of business models -- there &apos;s a model in Europe called the ec@@ o @-@ industrial park , where either the waste of one company is the ra@@ w material for another , or you use recy@@ cl@@ ed materials to make go@@ ods that you can actually use and sell .
we can create these local markets and inc@@ enti@@ ves for recy@@ cl@@ ed materials to be used as ra@@ w materials for manufac@@ turing .
and in my hom@@ et@@ own , we actually tried to do one of these in the Bron@@ x , but our ma@@ yo@@ r decided what he wanted to see was a ja@@ il on that same spot .
fortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs -- but after many years , the city wanted to build a ja@@ il .
they &apos;ve since ab@@ and@@ oned that project , thank go@@ od@@ ness .
another problem : un@@ healthy food systems and un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment .
working @-@ class and poor urban Americans are not ben@@ ef@@ iting econom@@ ically from our current food system .
it rel@@ ies too much on transpor@@ tation , chemical fer@@ tili@@ zation , big use of water and also re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation .
me@@ g@@ a agri@@ cultural oper@@ ations often are responsible for po@@ is@@ on@@ ing our wat@@ er@@ ways and our land , and it produ@@ ces this incredibly un@@ healthy product that costs us billions in health@@ care and lost produc@@ tivity .
and so we know &quot; urban a@@ g &quot; is a big bu@@ z@@ z top@@ ic this time of the year , but it &apos;s mostly gar@@ den@@ ing , which has some value in community building -- lots of it -- but it &apos;s not in terms of creating jobs or for food production .
the numbers just aren &apos;t there .
this can support seas@@ on@@ al farmers around met@@ r@@ o areas who are losing out because they really can &apos;t meet the year @-@ round demand for produce .
it &apos;s not a competition with rural farm ; it &apos;s actually rein@@ for@@ c@@ ements .
it al@@ lies in a really positive and econom@@ ically vi@@ able food system .
the goal is to meet the cities &apos; institu@@ tional dem@@ ands for hospit@@ als , sen@@ ior cen@@ ters , schools , da@@ y@@ care cen@@ ters , and produce a network of regi@@ on@@ al jobs , as well .
this is smart infrastructure .
and how we man@@ age our built environment affec@@ ts the health and well @-@ being of people every single day .
our m@@ uni@@ ci@@ p@@ ali@@ ties , rural and urban , play the oper@@ ational course of infrastructure -- things like waste dis@@ pos@@ al , energy demand , as well as social costs of un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment , drop @-@ out rates , in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rates and the imp@@ acts of various public health costs .
smart infrastructure can provide cost @-@ saving ways for m@@ uni@@ ci@@ p@@ ali@@ ties to hand@@ le both infrastructure and social needs .
and we want to shift the systems that open the do@@ ors for people who were for@@ mer@@ ly ta@@ x bur@@ den@@ s to become part of the ta@@ x base .
and imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic st@@ ability .
so I &apos;m hop@@ ing you can see a little the@@ me here .
these examples indic@@ ate a tr@@ end .
I haven &apos;t created it , and it &apos;s not happening by accident .
I &apos;m no@@ tic@@ ing that it &apos;s happening all over the country , and the good news is that it &apos;s growing .
and we all need to be inves@@ ted in it .
it is an essential p@@ ill@@ ar to this country &apos;s re@@ co@@ very .
and I call it &quot; hom@@ et@@ own security . &quot;
the rec@@ ession has us re@@ el@@ ing and f@@ ear@@ ful , and there &apos;s something in the air these days that is also very em@@ power@@ ing .
it &apos;s a reali@@ zation that we are the key to our own re@@ co@@ very .
now is the time for us to act in our own communities where we think local and we act local .
and when we do that , our neighb@@ ors -- be they next @-@ door , or in the next state , or in the next country -- The sum of the local is the global .
hom@@ et@@ own security means re@@ building our natural de@@ fen@@ ses , putting people to work , res@@ tor@@ ing our natural systems .
hom@@ et@@ own security means creating wealth here at home , instead of destro@@ ying it over@@ se@@ as .
tac@@ kl@@ ing social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution y@@ iel@@ ds great cost sa@@ v@@ ings , wealth generation and national security .
many great and in@@ spir@@ ing solutions have been gener@@ ated across America .
the challenge for us now is to identi@@ fy and support coun@@ t@@ less more .
now , hom@@ et@@ own security is about taking care of your own , but it &apos;s not like the old saying , &quot; char@@ ity begins at home . &quot;
I recently read a book called &quot; Lo@@ ve L@@ ea@@ der@@ ship &quot; by John H@@ ope Br@@ y@@ ant .
and it &apos;s about leading in a world that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear .
and reading that book made me re@@ exam@@ ine that theory because I need to explain what I mean by that .
see , my dad was a great , great man in many ways .
he grew up in the se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated South , es@@ cap@@ ed ly@@ n@@ ching and all that during some really hard times , and he provi@@ ded a really st@@ able home for me and my si@@ bl@@ ings and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times .
but , like all of us , he had some problems .
and his was g@@ am@@ bling , comp@@ ul@@ si@@ vely .
to him that p@@ hr@@ ase , &quot; Char@@ ity begins at home , &quot; meant that my pa@@ y@@ day -- or someone else &apos;s -- would just happen to co@@ inci@@ de with his lucky day .
so you need to help him out .
and sometimes I would lo@@ an him money from my after @-@ school or summer jobs , and he always had the great inten@@ tion of paying me back with interest , of course , after he hit it big .
and he did sometimes , believe it or not , at a ra@@ c@@ et@@ ra@@ ck in Los Angeles -- one reason to love L@@ .@@ A@@ . -- back in the 194@@ 0s .
he made 1@@ 5,000 dollars c@@ ash and bought the house that I grew up in .
so I &apos;m not that un@@ happy about that .
but listen , I did feel ob@@ li@@ g@@ ated to him , and I grew up -- then I grew up .
and I &apos;m a grown woman now , and I have learned a few things along the way .
to me , char@@ ity often is just about giving , because you &apos;re supposed to , or because it &apos;s what you &apos;ve always done , or it &apos;s about giving until it hur@@ ts .
I &apos;m about provi@@ ding the means to build something that will grow and intensi@@ fy its original investment and not just requ@@ ire greater giving next year -- I &apos;m not trying to feed the hab@@ it .
I spent some years watching how good inten@@ tions for community em@@ power@@ ment , that were supposed to be there to support the community and em@@ power it , actually left people in the same , if not worse , position that they were in before .
and over the past 20 years , we &apos;ve spent record amoun@@ ts of ph@@ il@@ anthrop@@ ic dollars on social problems , yet educ@@ ational out@@ comes , mal@@ nutri@@ tion , in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , obes@@ ity , di@@ abetes , income dis@@ par@@ ity , they &apos;ve all gone up with some exc@@ ep@@ tions -- in particular , in@@ f@@ ant mortality among people in poverty -- but it &apos;s a great world that we &apos;re bringing them into as well .
and I know a little bit about these issues , because , for many years , I spent a long time in the non @-@ profit industrial complex , and I &apos;m a re@@ co@@ vering ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive direc@@ tor , two years clean .
but during that time , I realized that it was about projects and developing them on the local level that really was going to do the right thing for our communities .
but I really did stru@@ ggle for financial support .
the greater our success , the less money came in from foun@@ da@@ tions .
and I tell you , being on the TED stage and w@@ inning a Mac@@ Ar@@ th@@ ur in the same ex@@ act year gave everyone the impres@@ sion that I had arrived .
and by the time I &apos;d moved on , I was actually co@@ vering a third of my agen@@ cy &apos;s budget de@@ fic@@ it with speaking fe@@ es .
and I think because early on , f@@ rank@@ ly , my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time .
but since then , the park that was just a du@@ mp and was fe@@ at@@ ured at a TED@@ 2006 T@@ al@@ k became this little thing .
but I did in fact get married in it .
over here .
there goes my dog who led me to the park in my we@@ d@@ ding .
the South Bron@@ x Gre@@ en@@ way was also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006 .
since then , we got about 50 million dollars in stimul@@ us pack@@ age money to come and get here .
and we love this , because I love construction now , because we &apos;re watching these things actually happen .
so I want everyone to understand the critical importance of shif@@ ting char@@ ity into enter@@ pr@@ ise .
I started my fir@@ m to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people .
hom@@ et@@ own security is next on my to @-@ do list .
what we need are people who see the value in inves@@ ting in these types of local enter@@ pris@@ es , who will partner with fol@@ ks like me to identi@@ fy the growth tr@@ ends and climate adap@@ tation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual .
we need to work together to embra@@ ce and re@@ pair our land , re@@ pair our power systems and re@@ pair ourselves .
it &apos;s time to stop building the sh@@ opp@@ ing m@@ alls , the pris@@ ons , the sta@@ di@@ ums and other trib@@ utes to all of our collective fail@@ ures .
it is time that we start building living mon@@ um@@ ents to hope and possibility .
thank you very much .
Ma@@ j@@ or@@ a Car@@ ter : 3 stories of local ec@@ o @-@ entrepreneur@@ ship
the future of green is local -- and entrepren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al . in her talk , Ma@@ j@@ or@@ a Car@@ ter brings us the stories of three people who are saving their own communities while saving the planet . call it &quot; hom@@ et@@ own security . &quot; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
&quot; even in pur@@ ely non @-@ religious terms , hom@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ ality repres@@ ents a mis@@ use of the sex@@ ual fac@@ ul@@ ty .
it is a pa@@ thetic little second @-@ rate sub@@ stitu@@ te for reality -- a pi@@ ti@@ able flight from life .
as such , it des@@ er@@ ves no compassion , it des@@ er@@ ves no treatment as min@@ ority mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom , and it des@@ er@@ ves not to be de@@ em@@ ed anything but a per@@ ni@@ cious si@@ ck@@ ness . &quot;
that &apos;s from Ti@@ me magazine in 196@@ 6 , when I was three years old .
and last year , the president of the United States came out in fa@@ vor of ga@@ y marri@@ age .
and my question is , how did we get from there to here ?
how did an ill@@ ness become an identity ?
when I was perhaps six years old , I went to a sho@@ e store with my mother and my brother .
and at the end of bu@@ ying our shoes , the sal@@ es@@ man said to us that we could each have a bal@@ lo@@ on to take home .
my brother wanted a red bal@@ lo@@ on , and I wanted a p@@ ink bal@@ lo@@ on .
my mother said that she thought I &apos;d really rather have a blue bal@@ lo@@ on .
but I said that I definitely wanted the p@@ ink one .
and she re@@ min@@ ded me that my favorite color was blue .
the fact that my favorite color now is blue , but I &apos;m still ga@@ y -- -- is evidence of both my mother &apos;s influence and its limit@@ s .
when I was little , my mother used to say , &quot; The love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world .
and until you have children , you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like . &quot;
and when I was little , I took it as the greatest comp@@ li@@ ment in the world that she would say that about par@@ enting my brother and me .
and when I was an ad@@ ol@@ es@@ cent , I thought that I &apos;m ga@@ y , and so I probably can &apos;t have a family .
and when she said it , it made me an@@ xi@@ ous .
and after I came out of the clos@@ et , when she continu@@ ed to say it , it made me fu@@ ri@@ ous .
I said , &quot; I &apos;m ga@@ y . that &apos;s not the direction that I &apos;m head@@ ed in .
and I want you to stop saying that . &quot;
about 20 years ago , I was asked by my edi@@ tors at The New York Times M@@ ag@@ a@@ z@@ ine to write a piece about dea@@ f culture .
and I was rather taken ab@@ ack .
I had thought of de@@ af@@ ness entirely as an ill@@ ness .
those poor people , they couldn &apos;t hear .
they l@@ ac@@ ked hearing , and what could we do for them ?
and then I went out into the dea@@ f world .
I went to dea@@ f clu@@ bs .
I saw per@@ for@@ man@@ ces of dea@@ f theater and of dea@@ f po@@ etry .
I even went to the Mis@@ s D@@ ea@@ f America con@@ test in N@@ ash@@ ville , T@@ en@@ nes@@ see where people com@@ pla@@ ined about that sl@@ ur@@ ry S@@ ou@@ thern sig@@ ning .
and as I pl@@ ung@@ ed deep@@ er and deep@@ er into the dea@@ f world , I become convin@@ ced that de@@ af@@ ness was a culture and that the people in the dea@@ f world who said , &quot; We don &apos;t lack hearing , we have mem@@ ber@@ ship in a culture , &quot; were saying something that was vi@@ able .
it wasn &apos;t my culture , and I didn &apos;t particularly want to r@@ ush off and join it , but I appreci@@ ated that it was a culture and that for the people who were members of it , it felt as valu@@ able as L@@ at@@ in@@ o culture or ga@@ y culture or Je@@ wish culture .
it felt as val@@ id perhaps even as American culture .
then a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a d@@ war@@ f .
and when her daughter was born , she suddenly found her@@ self con@@ fron@@ ting questions that now began to seem quite res@@ on@@ ant to me .
she was facing the question of what to do with this child .
should she say , &quot; You &apos;re just like everyone else but a little bit shor@@ ter ? &quot;
or should she try to constru@@ ct some kind of d@@ war@@ f identity , get involved in the L@@ it@@ tle Pe@@ op@@ le of America , become aware of what was happening for d@@ war@@ fs ?
and I suddenly thought , most dea@@ f children are born to hearing parents .
those hearing parents tend to try to cure them .
those dea@@ f people discover community somehow in ad@@ ol@@ es@@ c@@ ence .
most ga@@ y people are born to straight parents .
those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am world , and those ga@@ y people have to discover identity later on .
and here was this friend of mine looking at these questions of identity with her d@@ war@@ f daughter .
and I thought , there it is again : a family that percei@@ ves itself to be normal with a child who seems to be extraordinary .
and I hat@@ ched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity .
there are ver@@ tical identi@@ ties , which are passed down gener@@ a@@ tion@@ ally from par@@ ent to child .
those are things like eth@@ ni@@ city , frequ@@ ently na@@ tion@@ ality , language , often religion .
those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children .
and while some of them can be difficult , there &apos;s no attemp@@ t to cure them .
you can argue that it &apos;s harder in the United States -- our current pres@@ iden@@ cy not@@ with@@ standing -- to be a person of color .
and yet , we have nobody who is trying to en@@ sure that the next generation of children born to African @-@ Americans and A@@ si@@ ans come out with cre@@ am@@ y skin and yellow hair .
there are these other identi@@ ties which you have to learn from a pe@@ er group .
and I call them h@@ ori@@ z@@ on@@ tal identi@@ ties , because the pe@@ er group is the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on@@ tal experience .
these are identi@@ ties that are alien to your parents and that you have to discover when you get to see them in pe@@ ers .
and those identi@@ ties , those h@@ ori@@ z@@ on@@ tal identi@@ ties , people have almost always tried to cure .
and I wanted to look at what the process is through which people who have those identi@@ ties come to a good relationship with them .
and it seemed to me that there were three levels of accep@@ t@@ ance that needed to take place .
there &apos;s self @-@ accep@@ t@@ ance , there &apos;s family accep@@ t@@ ance , and there &apos;s social accep@@ t@@ ance .
and they don &apos;t always co@@ inci@@ de .
and a lot of the time , people who have these conditions are very an@@ gry because they feel as though their parents don &apos;t love them , when what actually has happened is that their parents don &apos;t acc@@ ept them .
love is something that ide@@ ally is there un@@ condi@@ tion@@ ally throughout the relationship between a par@@ ent and a child .
but accep@@ t@@ ance is something that takes time .
it always takes time .
one of the d@@ war@@ fs I got to know was a guy named C@@ lin@@ ton Bro@@ wn .
when he was born , he was diagnos@@ ed with di@@ ast@@ rop@@ hic d@@ war@@ f@@ ism , a very dis@@ ab@@ ling condition , and his parents were told that he would never walk , he would never talk , he would have no intellectual capacity , and he would probably not even recognize them .
and it was sugges@@ ted to them that they leave him at the hospital so that he could die there qui@@ et@@ ly .
and his mother said she wasn &apos;t going to do it .
and she took her son home .
and even though she didn &apos;t have a lot of educ@@ ational or financial advan@@ ta@@ ges , she found the best doctor in the country for dealing with di@@ ast@@ rop@@ hic d@@ war@@ f@@ ism , and she got C@@ lin@@ ton en@@ roll@@ ed with him .
and in the course of his childhood , he had 30 major sur@@ gical proce@@ dur@@ es .
and he spent all this time stuck in the hospital while he was having those proce@@ dur@@ es , as a result of which he now can walk .
and while he was there , they sent tu@@ tors around to help him with his school work .
and he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do .
and he ended up achie@@ ving at a level that had never before been con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ated by any member of his family .
he was the first one in his family , in fact , to go to college , where he lived on camp@@ us and dro@@ ve a speci@@ ally @-@ f@@ it@@ ted car that ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ated his un@@ usual body .
and his mother told me this story of coming home one day -- and he went to college ne@@ ar@@ by -- and she said , &quot; I saw that car , which you can always recognize , in the par@@ king lot of a bar , &quot; she said .
&quot; and I thought to myself , they &apos;re six feet t@@ all , he &apos;s three feet t@@ all .
two be@@ ers for them is four be@@ ers for him . &quot;
she said , &quot; I knew I couldn &apos;t go in there and inter@@ rup@@ t him , but I went home , and I left him eight mes@@ sa@@ ges on his cell phone . &quot;
she said , &quot; And then I thought , if someone had said to me when he was born that my future worry would be that he &apos;d go drin@@ king and driving with his college bu@@ d@@ dies -- &quot; And I said to her , &quot; What do you think you did that helped him to emer@@ ge as this char@@ ming , ac@@ com@@ pl@@ ished , wonderful person ? &quot;
and she said , &quot; What did I do ? I loved him , that &apos;s all .
C@@ lin@@ ton just always had that light in him .
and his father and I were lucky enough to be the first to see it there . &quot;
I &apos;m going to quote from another magazine of the &apos; 6@@ 0s .
this one is from 196@@ 8 -- The Atlan@@ tic Mon@@ th@@ ly , voice of liber@@ al America -- written by an important bio@@ eth@@ ic@@ ist .
he said , &quot; T@@ here is no reason to feel gu@@ il@@ ty about putting a D@@ own syn@@ dro@@ me child away , whether it is put away in the sense of hidden in a san@@ it@@ ari@@ um or in a more responsible , le@@ th@@ al sense .
it is sad , yes -- dre@@ ad@@ ful . but it car@@ ries no gu@@ il@@ t .
true gu@@ il@@ t ar@@ is@@ es only from an off@@ en@@ se against a person , and a D@@ own &apos;s is not a person . &quot;
there &apos;s been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we &apos;ve made in the treatment of ga@@ y people .
the fact that our at@@ titude has changed is in the head@@ lines every day .
but we forget how we used to see people who had other differences , how we used to see people who were dis@@ ab@@ led , how in@@ human we held people to be .
and the change that &apos;s been ac@@ com@@ pl@@ ished there , which is almost equ@@ ally radical , is one that we pay not very much attention to .
one of the families I intervie@@ wed , Tom and Kar@@ en Rob@@ ards , were taken ab@@ ack when , as young and successful New Y@@ or@@ kers , their first child was diagnos@@ ed with D@@ own syn@@ dro@@ me .
they thought the educ@@ ational opportunities for him were not what they should be , and so they decided they would build a little center -- two class@@ rooms that they started with a few other parents -- to educ@@ ate kids with D@@ .@@ S .
and over the years , that center grew into something called the Co@@ o@@ ke Center , where there are now thousands upon thousands of children with intellectual dis@@ abilities who are being taught .
in the time since that Atlan@@ tic Mon@@ th@@ ly story ran , the life expec@@ tan@@ cy for people with D@@ own syn@@ dro@@ me has tri@@ pl@@ ed .
the experience of D@@ own syn@@ dro@@ me people inclu@@ des those who are ac@@ tors , those who are wri@@ ters , some who are able to live fully in@@ depen@@ d@@ ently in ad@@ ul@@ tho@@ od .
the Rob@@ ards had a lot to do with that .
and I said , &quot; D@@ o you re@@ gre@@ t it ?
do you wish your child didn &apos;t have D@@ own syn@@ dro@@ me ?
do you wish you &apos;d never heard of it ? &quot;
and inter@@ est@@ ingly his father said , &quot; Well , for David , our son , I re@@ gre@@ t it , because for David , it &apos;s a difficult way to be in the world , and I &apos;d like to give David an easier life .
but I think if we lost everyone with D@@ own syn@@ dro@@ me , it would be a cat@@ ast@@ rop@@ hic loss . &quot;
and Kar@@ en Rob@@ ards said to me , &quot; I &apos;m with Tom .
for David , I would cure it in an inst@@ ant to give him an easier life .
but speaking for myself -- well , I would never have believed 23 years ago when he was born that I could come to such a point -- speaking for myself , it &apos;s made me so much better and so much kin@@ der and so much more pur@@ pos@@ eful in my whole life , that speaking for myself , I wouldn &apos;t give it up for anything in the world . &quot;
we live at a point when social accep@@ t@@ ance for these and many other conditions is on the up and up .
and yet we also live at the moment when our ability to elimin@@ ate those conditions has reach@@ ed a hei@@ ght we never imag@@ ined before .
most dea@@ f in@@ fan@@ ts born in the United States now will recei@@ ve Co@@ ch@@ le@@ ar im@@ plants , which are put into the brain and connected to a recei@@ ver , and which allow them to acqu@@ ire a fac@@ si@@ mile of hearing and to use oral speech .
a com@@ po@@ und that has been tes@@ ted in mi@@ ce , B@@ M@@ N @-@ 1@@ 11 , is useful in pre@@ vent@@ ing the action of the ach@@ on@@ dro@@ plas@@ ia gene .
ach@@ on@@ dro@@ plas@@ ia is the most common form of d@@ war@@ f@@ ism , and mi@@ ce who have been given that sub@@ st@@ ance and who have the ach@@ on@@ dro@@ plas@@ ia gene , grow to full size .
testing in humans is around the corner .
there are blood tests which are making progress that would pick up D@@ own syn@@ dro@@ me more clearly and earlier in pre@@ g@@ nan@@ cies than ever before , making it easier and easier for people to elimin@@ ate those pre@@ g@@ nan@@ cies , or to ter@@ min@@ ate them .
and so we have both social progress and medical progress .
and I believe in both of them .
I believe the social progress is fantastic and meaning@@ ful and wonderful , and I think the same thing about the medical progress .
but I think it &apos;s a tra@@ ge@@ dy when one of them doesn &apos;t see the other .
and when I see the way they &apos;re inter@@ se@@ cting in conditions like the three I &apos;ve just described , I sometimes think it &apos;s like those moments in gr@@ and oper@@ a when the her@@ o reali@@ zes he lo@@ ves the her@@ o@@ ine at the ex@@ act moment that she lies exp@@ ir@@ ing on a di@@ van .
we have to think about how we feel about cur@@ es al@@ together .
and a lot of the time the question of par@@ en@@ tho@@ od is , what do we v@@ ali@@ date in our children , and what do we cure in them ?
J@@ im S@@ in@@ cla@@ ir , a pro@@ min@@ ent au@@ tis@@ m activ@@ ist , said , &quot; W@@ hen parents say &apos; I wish my child did not have au@@ tis@@ m , &apos; what they &apos;re really saying is &apos; I wish the child I have did not exist and I had a different , non @-@ au@@ ti@@ sti@@ c child instead . &apos; read that again . this is what we hear when you m@@ our@@ n over our existence .
this is what we hear when you pra@@ y for a cure -- that your f@@ on@@ dest wish for us is that some@@ day we will c@@ ease to be and stran@@ gers you can love will move in behind our faces . &quot;
it &apos;s a very extreme point of view , but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have and they don &apos;t want to be cu@@ red or changed or elimin@@ ated .
they want to be wh@@ o@@ ever it is that they &apos;ve come to be .
one of the families I intervie@@ wed for this project was the family of D@@ yl@@ an K@@ le@@ b@@ old who was one of the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors of the Col@@ um@@ bine m@@ ass@@ ac@@ re .
it took a long time to per@@ su@@ ade them to talk to me , and once they agre@@ ed , they were so full of their story that they couldn &apos;t stop telling it .
and the first we@@ ek@@ end I spent with them -- the first of many -- I recor@@ ded more than 20 hours of conversation .
and on S@@ un@@ day night , we were all ex@@ hau@@ sted .
we were sitting in the kit@@ chen . S@@ ue K@@ le@@ b@@ old was fix@@ ing dinner .
and I said , &quot; If D@@ yl@@ an were here now , do you have a sense of what you &apos;d want to ask him ? &quot;
and his father said , &quot; I sure do .
I &apos;d want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing . &quot;
and S@@ ue looked at the floor , and she thought for a minute .
and then she looked back up and said , &quot; I would ask him to for@@ give me for being his mother and never knowing what was going on inside his head . &quot;
when I had dinner with her a couple of years later -- one of many d@@ inn@@ ers that we had together -- she said , &quot; You know , when it first happened , I used to wish that I had never married , that I had never had children .
if I hadn &apos;t gone to O@@ hi@@ o State and cros@@ sed pa@@ ths with Tom , this child wouldn &apos;t have exis@@ ted and this terrible thing wouldn &apos;t have happened .
but I &apos;ve come to feel that I love the children I had so much that I don &apos;t want to imagine a life without them .
I recognize the pain they caused to others , for which there can be no for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess , but the pain they caused to me , there is , &quot; she said .
&quot; so while I recognize that it would have been better for the world if D@@ yl@@ an had never been born , I &apos;ve decided that it would not have been better for me . &quot;
I thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems , problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid , and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of par@@ enting .
and then I thought , all of us who have children love the children we have , with their fla@@ ws .
if some gl@@ ori@@ ous an@@ gel suddenly des@@ cen@@ ded through my living room c@@ eil@@ ing and off@@ ered to take away the children I have and give me other , better children -- more poli@@ te , fun@@ ni@@ er , ni@@ cer , smar@@ ter -- I would cl@@ ing to the children I have and pra@@ y away that at@@ ro@@ cious spec@@ tac@@ le .
and ultimately I feel that in the same way that we test fl@@ ame @-@ re@@ tar@@ d@@ ant pa@@ j@@ am@@ as in an in@@ fer@@ no to en@@ sure they won &apos;t catch fire when our child reach@@ es across the sto@@ ve , so these stories of families negoti@@ ating these extreme differences refle@@ ct on the universal experience of par@@ enting , which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think , where did you come from ?
ir@@ on@@ ically , it turns out , that it &apos;s our differences , and our negoti@@ ation of difference , that uni@@ te us .
I decided to have children while I was working on this project .
and many people were ast@@ on@@ ished and said , &quot; B@@ ut how can you decide to have children in the mi@@ d@@ st of studying everything that can go wrong ? &quot;
and I said , &quot; I &apos;m not studying everything that can go wrong .
what I &apos;m studying is how much love there can be , even when everything appe@@ ars to be going wrong . &quot;
I thought a lot about the mother of one dis@@ ab@@ led child I had seen , a sever@@ ely dis@@ ab@@ led child who died through car@@ egi@@ ver ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct .
and when his ash@@ es were inter@@ red , his mother said , &quot; I pra@@ y here for for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess for having been twice rob@@ bed , once of the child I wanted and once of the son I loved . &quot;
and I figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child if they had the effective will to do so .
so my husband is the biological father of two children with some l@@ es@@ bi@@ an friends in Min@@ ne@@ ap@@ o@@ li@@ s .
I had a close friend from college who &apos;d gone through a di@@ vor@@ ce and wanted to have children .
and so she and I have a daughter , and mother and daughter live in Texas .
and my husband and I have a son who lives with us all the time of whom I am the biological father , and our surro@@ gate for the pre@@ g@@ nan@@ cy was Lau@@ ra , the l@@ es@@ bi@@ an mother of O@@ liver and Lu@@ cy in Min@@ ne@@ ap@@ o@@ li@@ s .
so the shor@@ th@@ and is five parents of four children in three states .
and there are people who think that the existence of my family somehow under@@ min@@ es or we@@ ak@@ ens or dama@@ ges their family .
and there are people who think that families like mine shouldn &apos;t be allowed to exist .
and I don &apos;t acc@@ ept sub@@ tra@@ ctive models of love , only addi@@ tive ones .
and I believe that in the same way that we need species diversity to en@@ sure that the planet can go on , so we need this diversity of affec@@ tion and diversity of family in order to streng@@ then the ec@@ osp@@ here of kin@@ dness .
the day after our son was born , the pe@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ cian came into the hospital room and said she was concerned .
he wasn &apos;t exten@@ ding his legs appropri@@ ately .
she said that might mean that he had brain damage .
in so far as he was exten@@ ding them , he was doing so as@@ y@@ mm@@ et@@ ri@@ cally , which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action .
and he had a very large head , which she thought might indic@@ ate hydro@@ c@@ ep@@ hal@@ us .
and as she told me all of these things , I felt the very center of my being p@@ our@@ ing out onto the floor .
and I thought , here I had been working for years on a book about how much meaning people had found in the experience of par@@ enting children who are dis@@ ab@@ led , and I didn &apos;t want to join their number .
because what I was en@@ counter@@ ing was an idea of ill@@ ness .
and like all parents since the da@@ wn of time , I wanted to protect my child from ill@@ ness .
and I wanted also to protect myself from ill@@ ness .
and yet , I knew from the work I had done that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for , that those would ultimately be his identity , and if they were his identity they would become my identity , that that ill@@ ness was going to take a very different shape as it un@@ fol@@ ded .
we took him to the MR@@ I machine , we took him to the CA@@ T scan@@ ner , we took this day @-@ old child and gave him over for an ar@@ ter@@ ial blood draw .
we felt hel@@ pl@@ ess .
and at the end of five hours , they said that his brain was completely clear and that he was by then exten@@ ding his legs cor@@ rec@@ tly .
and when I asked the pe@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ cian what had been going on , she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cra@@ mp .
but I thought how my mother was right .
I thought , the love you have for your children is un@@ like any other feeling in the world , and until you have children , you don &apos;t know what it feels like .
I think children had ens@@ nar@@ ed me the moment I connected fa@@ ther@@ hood with loss .
but I &apos;m not sure I would have noticed that if I hadn &apos;t been so in the th@@ ick of this research project of mine .
I &apos;d en@@ counter@@ ed so much strange love , and I fell very natur@@ ally into its be@@ wit@@ ching patterns .
and I saw how sp@@ l@@ end@@ or can ill@@ um@@ in@@ ate even the most ab@@ ject vulner@@ abilities .
during these 10 years , I had wit@@ n@@ essed and learned the terri@@ fying joy of un@@ be@@ ar@@ able responsibility , and I had come to see how it con@@ qu@@ ers everything else .
and while I had sometimes thought the parents I was intervie@@ wing were fo@@ ols , ens@@ la@@ ving themselves to a life@@ time &apos;s journey with their than@@ kl@@ ess children and trying to bre@@ ed identity out of mis@@ ery , I realized that day that my research had built me a pl@@ ank and that I was ready to join them on their ship .
thank you .
An@@ drew S@@ ol@@ om@@ on : love , no matter what
what is it like to raise a child who &apos;s different from you in some fundamental way ? in this qui@@ et@@ ly moving talk , writer An@@ drew S@@ ol@@ om@@ on shares what he learned from talking to do@@ zens of parents -- asking them : what &apos;s the line between un@@ condi@@ tional love and un@@ condi@@ tional accep@@ t@@ ance ?
most people don &apos;t know that when I went to high school in this country -- I app@@ lied for university at a time when I was convin@@ ced I was going to be an artist and be a sculp@@ tor .
and I came from a very privi@@ le@@ ged background . I was very lucky .
my family was we@@ al@@ thy , and my father believed in one thing , and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted .
and I announ@@ ced I wanted to be a sculp@@ tor in Paris .
and he was a clever man . he sort of said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s OK , but you &apos;ve done very well in your math S@@ A@@ T@@ s . &quot;
in fact , I &apos;d got an 800 . and he thought I did very well -- and I did , too -- in the arts : this was my passion .
and he said &quot; If you go to MIT , &quot; to which I had been given early ad@@ mission , &quot; I will pay for every year you &apos;re at MIT , in graduate or under@@ graduate -- as much as you want -- I will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in Paris . &quot;
and I thought that was the best deal in town , so I accep@@ ted it immediately .
and I decided that if I was good in art , and I was good in mathematics , I &apos;d study architecture , which was the bl@@ ending of the two .
I went and told my head@@ master that , at pre@@ p school .
and I said to him what I was doing , that I was going to go study architecture because it was art and mathematics put together .
he said to me something that just went completely over my head .
he said , &quot; You know , I like gre@@ y su@@ its , and I like p@@ in @-@ stri@@ ped su@@ its , but I don &apos;t like gre@@ y p@@ in @-@ stri@@ ped su@@ its . &quot;
and I thought , &quot; What a tur@@ key this guy is , &quot; and I went off to MIT .
I studied architecture , then did a second degree in architecture , and then actually quickly realized that it wasn &apos;t architecture .
that really , the mix@@ ing of art and science was computers , and that that really was the place to bring both , and enjo@@ yed a career doing that .
and probably , if I were to fill out J@@ im C@@ it@@ r@@ in &apos;s scale , I &apos;d put 100 percent on the side of the equ@@ ation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative .
and after doing this for a long time , and the Medi@@ a L@@ ab pas@@ sing the bat@@ on on , I thought , &quot; Well , maybe it &apos;s time for me to do a project .
something that would be important , but also something that would take advantage of all of these privi@@ le@@ ges that one had . &quot;
and in the case of the Medi@@ a L@@ ab , knowing a lot of people , knowing people who were either ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tives or we@@ al@@ thy , and also not having , in my own case , a career to worry about anymore .
my career , I mean , I &apos;d done my career .
didn &apos;t have to worry about ear@@ ning money .
didn &apos;t have to worry about what people thought about me .
and I said , &quot; Bo@@ y , let &apos;s really do something that takes advantage of all these fe@@ atures , &quot; and thought that if we could address education , by le@@ ver@@ aging the children , and bringing to the world the access of the computers , that that was really the thing we should do .
never shown this picture before , and probably going to be su@@ ed for it .
it &apos;s taken at three o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck in the morning , without the per@@ mission of the company .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . there they are , fol@@ ks .
if you look at the picture , you &apos;ll see they &apos;re stac@@ ked up .
those are con@@ ve@@ yo@@ r bel@@ ts that go around .
this is one of the con@@ ve@@ yo@@ r bel@@ ts with the thing going by , but then you &apos;ll see the ones up above .
what happens is , they bur@@ n into flas@@ h memory the software , and then test them for a few hours .
but you &apos;ve got to have the thing moving on the assem@@ bly line , because it &apos;s const@@ ant .
so they go around in this loo@@ p , which is why you see them up there .
so this was great for us because it was a real turning point . but it goes back .
this picture was taken in 198@@ 2 , just before the I@@ B@@ M P@@ C was even announ@@ ced .
Se@@ y@@ m@@ our P@@ ap@@ ert and I were bringing computers to schools and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself .
but one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here .
and when people tell me , &quot; W@@ h@@ o &apos;s going to teach the teachers to teach the kids ? &quot;
I say to myself , &quot; What planet do you come from ? &quot;
okay , there &apos;s not a person in this room -- I don &apos;t care how te@@ ch@@ ie you are -- there &apos;s not a person in this room that doesn &apos;t give their l@@ aptop or cell phone to a kid to help them de@@ bu@@ g it . OK ?
we all need help , even those of us who are very seas@@ oned .
this picture of Se@@ y@@ m@@ our -- 25 years ago . Se@@ y@@ m@@ our made a very simple observ@@ ation in 196@@ 8 , and then basically pres@@ ented it in 19@@ 70 -- A@@ pri@@ l 11 to be pre@@ cise -- called &quot; T@@ ea@@ ching Ch@@ il@@ dr@@ en T@@ hin@@ king . &quot;
what he ob@@ ser@@ ved was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently , and when they de@@ bu@@ g the programs , they come the clos@@ est to learning about learning .
that was very important , and in some sense , we &apos;ve lost that .
kids don &apos;t program enough and boy , if there &apos;s anything I hope this brings back , it &apos;s progra@@ mming to kids .
it &apos;s really important . using app@@ lications is OK , but progra@@ mming is absolutely fundamental .
this is being launched with three languages in it : S@@ qu@@ ea@@ k , L@@ og@@ o , and a third , that I &apos;ve never even seen before .
the point being , this is going to be very , very inten@@ sive on the progra@@ mming side .
this photograph is very important because it &apos;s much later .
this is in the early 200@@ 0s . my son , D@@ im@@ it@@ r@@ i -- who &apos;s here , many of you know D@@ im@@ it@@ r@@ i -- went to Cam@@ bo@@ di@@ a , set up this school that we had built , just as the school connected it to the Internet .
and these kids had their l@@ ap@@ tops . but it was really what spiri@@ ted this , plus the influence of Jo@@ e and others . we started One L@@ aptop per Ch@@ ild .
this is the same village in Cam@@ bo@@ di@@ a , just a couple of months ago .
these kids are real pro@@ s . there were just 7@@ ,000 machines out there being tes@@ ted by kids . being a non@@ profit is absolutely fundamental .
everybody ad@@ vis@@ ed me not to be a non@@ profit , but they were all wrong .
and the reason being a non@@ profit is important is actually t@@ wo@@ fold .
there are many reasons , but the two that mer@@ it the little bit of time is : one , the cl@@ ar@@ ity of purpose is there . the moral purpose is clear .
I can see any head of state , any ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive I want , at any time , because I &apos;m not selling l@@ ap@@ tops . OK ? I have no shar@@ eh@@ ol@@ ders .
whether we sell , it doesn &apos;t make any difference what@@ so@@ ever .
the cl@@ ar@@ ity of purpose is absolutely critical . and the second is very counter@@ intui@@ tive -- you can get the best people in the world .
if you look at our professional services , including search fir@@ ms , including communic@@ ations , including legal services , including ban@@ king , they &apos;re all pr@@ o bon@@ o . and it &apos;s not to save money .
we &apos;ve got money in the bank . it &apos;s because you get the best people .
you get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission , and they &apos;re the best people .
we couldn &apos;t afford to hi@@ re a C@@ F@@ O . we put out a job descri@@ p@@ tion for a C@@ F@@ O at zero sal@@ ary , and we had a qu@@ eu@@ e of people .
it allows you to team up with people . the U.@@ N. &apos; s not going to be our partner if we &apos;re profit making . so announ@@ cing this with K@@ o@@ f@@ i An@@ n@@ an was very important , and the U.@@ N. allowed us to basically reach all the countries . and this was the machine we were showing before I met Y@@ ves B@@ eh@@ ar .
and while this machine in some sense is sil@@ ly , in re@@ tr@@ os@@ pect , it actually ser@@ ved a very important purpose .
that pen@@ cil @-@ yellow c@@ rank was re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed by everybody .
everybody re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed the pen@@ cil @-@ yellow c@@ rank . it &apos;s different .
it was getting its power in a different way . it &apos;s kind of ch@@ il@@ d@@ like .
even though this wasn &apos;t the direction we went because the c@@ rank -- it really is stup@@ id to have it on board , by the way .
in sp@@ ite of what some people in the press don &apos;t get it , didn &apos;t understand it , we didn &apos;t take it off because we didn &apos;t want to do -- having it on the l@@ aptop itself is really not what you want .
you want a separate thing , like the A@@ C adap@@ tor .
I didn &apos;t bring one with me , but they really work much better off @-@ board .
and then , I could tell you lots about the l@@ aptop , but I decided on just four things .
just keep in mind -- because there are other people , including Bill G@@ ates , who said , &quot; Ge@@ e , you &apos;ve got a real computer . &quot;
that computer is un@@ like anything you &apos;ve had , and does things -- there are four of them -- that you don &apos;t come close to . and it &apos;s very important to be low power , and I hope that &apos;s picked up more by the industry .
that the reason that you want to be below two wat@@ ts is that &apos;s roughly what you can generate with your u@@ pper body .
du@@ al @-@ mo@@ de dis@@ play -- that sun@@ light dis@@ play &apos;s fantastic .
we were using it at lunch today in the sun@@ light , and the more sun@@ light the better .
and that was really critical . the mes@@ h network , it &apos;ll become com@@ mon@@ place .
and of course , &quot; ru@@ g@@ ged &quot; goes without saying .
and the reason I think design matters isn &apos;t because I wanted to go to art school .
and by the way , when I gradu@@ ated from MIT , I thought the worst and si@@ l@@ li@@ est thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years .
so , I didn &apos;t do that . but design matters for a number of reasons .
the most important being that it is the best way to make an in@@ expensive product .
most people make in@@ expensive products by taking cheap design , cheap labor , cheap compon@@ ents , and making a cheap l@@ aptop .
and , in English , the word &quot; cheap &quot; has a double meaning , which is really appropri@@ ate , because it &apos;s cheap , in the pe@@ j@@ or@@ ative sense , as well as in@@ expensive .
but if you take a different approach , and you think of very large @-@ scale inte@@ gra@@ tion , very advan@@ ced materials , very advan@@ ced manufac@@ turing -- so you &apos;re p@@ our@@ ing chemicals in one end , i@@ Po@@ ds are sp@@ e@@ wing out the other -- and really cool design , that &apos;s what we wanted to do .
and I can race through these and save a lot of time because Y@@ ves and I obviously didn &apos;t compare not@@ es .
these are his sli@@ des , and so I don &apos;t have to talk about them .
but it was really , to us , very important as a strategy .
it wasn &apos;t just to kind of make it cu@@ te , because somebody -- you know , good design is very important .
Y@@ ves showed one of the power @-@ gener@@ ating devices .
the mes@@ h network , the reason I -- and I won &apos;t go into it in great detail -- but when we deliver l@@ ap@@ tops to kids in the re@@ mot@@ est and poor@@ est parts of the world , they &apos;re connected . there &apos;s not just l@@ ap@@ tops .
and so , we have to drop in satelli@@ te dis@@ hes . we put in gener@@ ators .
it &apos;s a lot of stuff that goes behind these . these can talk to each other .
if you &apos;re in a desert , they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart .
if you &apos;re in the j@@ ung@@ le , it &apos;s about 500 meters . so if a kid b@@ ic@@ y@@ cles home , or wal@@ ks a few miles , they &apos;re going to be off the grid , so to speak .
they &apos;re not going to be near another l@@ aptop , so you have to na@@ il these onto a tree , and sort of , get it .
you don &apos;t call Ver@@ i@@ zon or S@@ print . you build your own network .
and that &apos;s very important , the user interface .
we are la@@ un@@ ching with 18 ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ards . English is by far the min@@ ority .
L@@ ati@@ n is rel@@ atively r@@ are , too . you just look at some of the languages .
I &apos;m willing to sus@@ pect some of you hadn &apos;t even heard of them before .
is there anybody in the room , one person , unless you work with O@@ L@@ P@@ C , is there anybody in the room that can tell me what language the ke@@ y@@ board is that &apos;s on the screen ? there &apos;s only one hand -- so you get it .
yes , you &apos;re right . he &apos;s right . it &apos;s Am@@ har@@ ic , it &apos;s E@@ thiop@@ ian . in E@@ thiop@@ ia , there &apos;s never been a ke@@ y@@ board .
there is no ke@@ y@@ board standard because there &apos;s no market .
and this is the big difference .
again , when you &apos;re a non@@ profit , you look at children as a mission , not as a market .
so we went to E@@ thiop@@ ia , and we helped them make a ke@@ y@@ board .
and this will become the standard E@@ thiop@@ ian ke@@ y@@ board .
so what I want to end with is sort of what we &apos;re doing to roll it out .
and we changed strategy completely . I decided at the beginning -- it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning , it &apos;s not what we &apos;re doing now -- is to go to six countries .
big countries , one of them is not so big , but it &apos;s rich .
here &apos;s the six . we went to the six , and in each case the head of state said he would do it , he &apos;d do a million .
in the case of G@@ ad@@ da@@ f@@ i , he &apos;d do 1.@@ 2 million , and that they would la@@ unch it .
we thought , this is exactly the right strategy , get it out , and then the little countries could sort of pig@@ g@@ y@@ back on these big countries .
and so I went to each of those countries at least six times , met with the head of state probably two or three times .
in each case , got the minis@@ ters , went through a lot of the stuff .
this was a period in my life where I was travel@@ ing 3@@ 30 days per year .
not something you &apos;d en@@ vy or want to do .
in the case of Li@@ b@@ ya , it was a lot of fun meeting G@@ ad@@ da@@ f@@ i in his tent .
the cam@@ el sm@@ ells were un@@ belie@@ vable .
and it was 45 degrees C. I mean , this was not what you &apos;d call a cool experience . and former countries -- I say former , because none of them really came through this summer -- there was a big difference between getting a head of state to have a photo opportunity , make a press rel@@ ease .
so we went to smaller ones . U@@ ru@@ gu@@ ay , bl@@ ess their hear@@ ts .
small country , not so rich . president said he &apos;d do it , and guess what ?
he did do it . the ten@@ der had nothing in it that related to us , nothing specific about sun@@ light @-@ re@@ ad@@ able , mes@@ h @-@ network , low @-@ power , but just a van@@ ill@@ a l@@ aptop pro@@ pos@@ al .
and guess what ? we won it hands down .
when it was announ@@ ced that they were going to do every child in U@@ ru@@ gu@@ ay , the first 100,000 , bo@@ om , went to O@@ L@@ P@@ C .
the next day -- the next day , not even 24 hours had passed -- in Per@@ u , the president of Per@@ u said , &quot; We &apos;ll do 250 . &quot; and bo@@ om , a little domin@@ o effect .
the president of R@@ wand@@ a st@@ ep@@ ped in and said he would do it .
the president of E@@ thiop@@ ia said he would do it .
and bo@@ om , bo@@ om , bo@@ om . the president of Mon@@ go@@ li@@ a .
and so what happens is , these things start to happen with these countries -- still not enough .
add up all those countries , it didn &apos;t quite get to thing , so we said , &quot; Le@@ t &apos;s start a program in the United States . &quot; so , end of Au@@ gust , early September , we decide to do this . we announ@@ ced it near the middle , end -- just when the C@@ lin@@ ton I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ative was taking place .
we thought that was a good time to announ@@ ce it .
launched it on the 12 of No@@ vember .
we said it would be just for a short period until the 26 . we &apos;ve exten@@ ded it until the 3@@ 1 .
and the &quot; Gi@@ ve One , Ge@@ t One &quot; program is really important because it got a lot of people absolutely interested .
the first day it was just wild . and then we said , &quot; Well , let &apos;s get people to give many . not just one , and get one , but maybe give 100 , give 1,000 . &quot; and that &apos;s where you come in .
and that &apos;s where I think it &apos;s very important . I don &apos;t want you all to go out and buy 400 dollars worth of l@@ ap@@ tops . okay ? do it , but that &apos;s not going to help . okay ?
if everybody in this room goes out ton@@ ight and orders one of these things for 400 dollars , whatever it is , 300 people in the room doing it -- yeah , great .
I want you do something else .
and it &apos;s not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000 , though , I in@@ vi@@ te you to do that , and 10,000 would be even better .
tell people about it ! it &apos;s got to become vi@@ ral , OK ?
use your ma@@ iling lis@@ ts . people in this room have extraordinary ma@@ iling lis@@ ts .
get your friends to give one , get one .
and if each one of you sen@@ ds it to 300 or 400 people , that would be fantastic .
I won &apos;t d@@ well on the pri@@ cing at all .
just to say that when you do the &quot; Gi@@ ve One , Ge@@ t One , &quot; a lot of press is a bit about , &quot; The@@ y didn &apos;t make it , it &apos;s 18@@ 8 dollars , it &apos;s not 100 . &quot;
it will be 100 in two years . it will go below 100 .
we &apos;ve ple@@ d@@ ged not to add fe@@ atures , but to bring that price down .
but it was the countries that wanted it to go up , and we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons . so what you can do -- I &apos;ve just said it . don &apos;t just give one , get one .
I just want to end with one last one . this one is not even 24 @-@ hours old , or maybe it &apos;s 24 @-@ hours .
the first kids got their l@@ ap@@ tops . they got them by ship , and I &apos;m talking now about 7@@ ,000 , 8@@ ,000 at a time went out this week .
they went to U@@ ru@@ gu@@ ay , Per@@ u , Mexico .
and it &apos;s been slow coming , and we &apos;re only making about 5,000 a week , but we hope , we hope , some@@ time in next year , maybe by the middle of the year , to hit a million a month . now put that number , and a million isn &apos;t so much . it &apos;s not a big number .
we &apos;re selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year .
but a million a month in l@@ aptop @-@ land is a big number .
and the world production today , everybody combin@@ ed , making l@@ ap@@ tops , is five million a month . so I &apos;m standing here telling you that some@@ time next year , we &apos;re going to make 20 percent of the world production .
and if we do that , there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there .
and we hope if you have E@@ G two years from now , or whenever you have it again , I won &apos;t have bad bre@@ ath , and I will be invited back , and will have , hopefully by then , maybe 100 million out there to children .
thank you .
N@@ ich@@ ol@@ as Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te : one L@@ aptop per Ch@@ ild , two years on
N@@ ich@@ ol@@ as Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te talks about how One L@@ aptop per Ch@@ ild is doing , two years in . speaking at the E@@ G conference while the first X@@ O l@@ ap@@ tops roll off the production line , he rec@@ aps the contro@@ versi@@ es and re@@ commit@@ s to the go@@ als of this far @-@ reach@@ ing project .
I , like many of you , am one of the two billion people on Earth who live in cities .
and there are days -- I don &apos;t know about the rest of you guys -- but there are days when I pal@@ p@@ ably feel how much I rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life .
and some days , that can even be a little scar@@ y .
but what I &apos;m here to talk to you about today is how that same inter@@ depen@@ dence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually har@@ ness to help he@@ al some of our deep@@ est ci@@ vi@@ c issues , if we apply open source collabor@@ ation .
a couple of years ago , I read an article by New York Times writer Michael P@@ oll@@ an in which he argu@@ ed that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment .
now at the time that I was reading this , it was the middle of the win@@ ter and I definitely did not have room for a lot of di@@ rt in my New York City ap@@ art@@ ment .
so I was basically just willing to sett@@ le for just reading the next Wi@@ red magazine and finding out how the experts were going to figure out how to solve all these problems for us in the future .
but that was actually exactly the point that Michael P@@ oll@@ an was making in this article -- was it &apos;s pre@@ cis@@ ely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to speci@@ alists that we cause the kind of m@@ esses that we see with the food system .
so , I happen to know a little bit from my own work about how NASA has been using hy@@ d@@ rop@@ on@@ ics to explore growing food in space .
and you can actually get op@@ ti@@ mal nutri@@ tional y@@ iel@@ d by running a kind of high @-@ quality li@@ quid soil over plants &apos; ro@@ ot systems .
now to a veget@@ able plant , my ap@@ art@@ ment has got to be about as foreign as ou@@ ter space .
but I can offer some natural light and year @-@ round climate control .
fast @-@ forward two years later : we now have window far@@ ms , which are ver@@ tical , hy@@ d@@ rop@@ on@@ ic plat@@ forms for food @-@ growing in@@ do@@ ors .
and the way it works is that there &apos;s a p@@ ump at the bottom , which peri@@ o@@ di@@ cally sen@@ ds some of this li@@ quid nutri@@ ent solution up to the top , which then tri@@ ck@@ les down through plants &apos; ro@@ ot systems that are sus@@ pen@@ ded in cla@@ y p@@ el@@ lets -- so there &apos;s no di@@ rt involved .
now light and temperature v@@ ary with each window &apos;s micro@@ climate , so a window farm requ@@ ires a far@@ mer , and she must decide what kind of c@@ rop@@ s she is going to put in her window farm , and whether she is going to feed her food organ@@ ically .
back at the time , a window farm was no more than a techni@@ cally complex idea that was going to requ@@ ire a lot of testing .
and I really wanted it to be an open project , because hy@@ d@@ rop@@ on@@ ics is one of the fa@@ st@@ est growing areas of pat@@ enting in the United States right now and could possibly become another area like Mon@@ san@@ to , where we have a lot of corpor@@ ate intellectual property in the way of people &apos;s food .
so I decided that , instead of creating a product , what I was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of co @-@ develop@@ ers .
the first few systems that we created , they kind of worked .
we were actually able to grow about a sal@@ ad a week in a typical New York City ap@@ art@@ ment window .
and we were able to grow ch@@ er@@ ry tom@@ at@@ oes and cu@@ cum@@ bers , all kinds of stuff .
but the first few systems were these le@@ ak@@ y , l@@ oud power @-@ gu@@ zz@@ l@@ ers that Mar@@ th@@ a Ste@@ war@@ t would definitely never have appro@@ ved .
so to bring on more co @-@ develop@@ ers , what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the desig@@ ns , we expla@@ ined how they worked , and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems .
and then we invited people all over the world to build them and experiment with us .
so actually now on this website , we have 18@@ ,000 people .
and we have window far@@ ms all over the world .
what we &apos;re doing is what NASA or a large corpor@@ ation would call R &amp; amp ; D , or research and development .
but what we call it is R &amp; amp ; D @-@ I @-@ Y , or research and develop it yourself .
so for example , J@@ ack@@ son came along and sugges@@ ted that we use air p@@ um@@ ps instead of water p@@ um@@ ps .
it took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right , but once we did , we were able to cut our carbon foot@@ print nearly in half .
Tony in Chicago has been taking on growing experiments , like lots of other window farmers , and he &apos;s been able to get his stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ries to fru@@ it for nine months of the year in low @-@ light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutri@@ ents .
and window farmers in Fin@@ land have been custom@@ i@@ zing their window far@@ ms for the dark days of the F@@ inn@@ ish w@@ inter@@ s by out@@ f@@ it@@ ting them with L@@ ED grow lights that they &apos;re now making open source and part of the project .
so window far@@ ms have been evol@@ ving through a rap@@ id versi@@ on@@ ing process similar to software .
and with every open source project , the real benefit is the inter@@ play between the specific concer@@ ns of people custom@@ i@@ zing their systems for their own particular concer@@ ns and the universal concer@@ ns .
so my core team and I are able to concent@@ rate on the impro@@ v@@ ements that really benefit everyone .
and we &apos;re able to look out for the needs of new@@ com@@ ers .
so for do @-@ it @-@ y@@ our@@ sel@@ f@@ ers , we provide free , very well @-@ tes@@ ted in@@ struc@@ tions so that anyone , anywhere around the world , can build one of these systems for free .
and there &apos;s a pat@@ ent pen@@ ding on these systems as well that &apos;s held by the community .
and to f@@ und the project , we partner to create products that we then sell to schools and to individuals who don &apos;t have time to build their own systems .
now within our community , a certain culture has appe@@ ared .
in our culture , it is better to be a tes@@ ter who suppor@@ ts someone else &apos;s idea than it is to be just the idea guy .
what we get out of this project is we get support for our own work , as well as an experience of actually con@@ trib@@ uting to the environmental movement in a way other than just scre@@ wing in new light bul@@ bs .
but I think that E@@ i@@ le@@ en expres@@ ses best what we really get out of this , which is the actual joy of collabor@@ ation .
so she expres@@ ses here what it &apos;s like to see someone hal@@ f@@ way across the world having taken your idea , built upon it and then ac@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ging you for con@@ trib@@ uting .
if we really want to see the kind of wide consu@@ mer behavior change that we &apos;re all talking about as environ@@ ment@@ alists and food people , maybe we just need to di@@ t@@ ch the term &quot; consu@@ mer &quot; and get behind the people who are doing stuff .
open source projects tend to have a moment@@ um of their own .
and what we &apos;re seeing is that R &amp; amp ; D @-@ I @-@ Y has moved beyond just window far@@ ms and L@@ E@@ D@@ s into solar pan@@ els and a@@ qu@@ ap@@ on@@ ic systems .
and we &apos;re building upon innov@@ ations of generations who went before us .
and we &apos;re looking ahead at generations who really need us to re@@ tool our lives now .

Bri@@ tt@@ a Ri@@ ley : a g@@ arden in my ap@@ art@@ ment
Bri@@ tt@@ a Ri@@ ley wanted to grow her own food . so she and her friends developed a system for growing plants in dis@@ car@@ ded plastic bot@@ tles -- resear@@ ching , testing and t@@ wea@@ king the system using social media , trying many vari@@ ations at once and quickly arri@@ ving at the op@@ ti@@ mal system . call it distribu@@ ted D@@ I@@ Y . and the results ? del@@ ici@@ ous . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so a friend of mine who &apos;s a political scientist , he told me several months ago exactly what this month would be like .
he said , you know , there &apos;s this fis@@ cal cli@@ ff coming , it &apos;s going to come at the beginning of 20@@ 13 .
both par@@ ties absolutely need to resol@@ ve it , but nei@@ ther party wants to be seen as the first to resol@@ ve it .
nei@@ ther party has any in@@ cen@@ tive to solve it a second before it &apos;s due , so he said , Dec@@ ember , you &apos;re just going to see lots of an@@ gry negoti@@ ations , negoti@@ ations brea@@ king apart , repor@@ ts of phone calls that aren &apos;t going well , people saying nothing &apos;s happening at all , and then some@@ time around Christ@@ mas or New Y@@ ear &apos;s , we &apos;re going to hear , &quot; Okay , they resol@@ ved everything . &quot;
he told me that a few months ago . he said he &apos;s 9@@ 8 percent positive they &apos;re going to resol@@ ve it , and I got an email from him today saying , all right , we &apos;re basically on track , but now I &apos;m 80 percent positive that they &apos;re going to resol@@ ve it .
and it made me think . I love studying these moments in American history when there was this f@@ ren@@ z@@ y of par@@ tis@@ an an@@ ger , that the economy was on the ver@@ ge of total collap@@ se .
the most famous early b@@ attle was Alex@@ ander H@@ am@@ il@@ ton and Thomas J@@ eff@@ er@@ son over what the dollar would be and how it would be bac@@ ked up , with Alex@@ ander H@@ am@@ il@@ ton saying , &quot; We need a central bank , the F@@ ir@@ st Bank of the United States , or else the dollar will have no value .
this economy won &apos;t work , &quot; and Thomas J@@ eff@@ er@@ son saying , &quot; The people won &apos;t trust that .
they just f@@ ought off a king . they &apos;re not going to acc@@ ept some central auth@@ ority . &quot;
this b@@ attle defin@@ ed the first 150 years of the U.S. economy , and at every moment , different par@@ tis@@ ans saying , &quot; Oh my God , the economy &apos;s about to collap@@ se , &quot; and the rest of us just going about , spending our bu@@ cks on whatever it is we wanted to buy .
to give you a quick pri@@ mer on where we are , a quick re@@ fres@@ her on where we are .
so the fis@@ cal cli@@ ff , I was told that that &apos;s too par@@ tis@@ an a thing to say , although I can &apos;t remember which party it &apos;s suppor@@ ting or attac@@ king .
people say we should call it the fis@@ cal slo@@ pe , or we should call it an au@@ ster@@ ity crisis , but then other people say , no , that &apos;s even more par@@ tis@@ an .
so I just call it the self @-@ im@@ posed , self @-@ destru@@ ctive ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ary de@@ ad@@ line about resol@@ ving an in@@ ev@@ itable problem .
and this is what the in@@ ev@@ itable problem looks like .
so this is a proje@@ ction of U.S. de@@ bt as a perc@@ ent@@ age of our over@@ all economy , of G@@ DP .
and at that moment our economy collap@@ ses .
but remember , Gre@@ e@@ ce is there today .
we &apos;re there in 20 years . we have lots and lots of time to avoid that crisis , and the fis@@ cal cli@@ ff was just one more attemp@@ t at trying to force the two sides to resol@@ ve the crisis .
here &apos;s another way to look at exactly the same problem .
the dark blue line is how much the government sp@@ ends .
the light blue line is how much the government gets in .
and as you can see , for most of recent history , except for a b@@ rief period , we have cons@@ ist@@ ently spent more than we take in . th@@ us the national de@@ bt .
but as you can also see , proje@@ cted going forward , the ga@@ p wi@@ den@@ s a bit and rais@@ es a bit , and this graph is only through 20@@ 21 .
it gets really , really ug@@ ly out towards 20@@ 30 .
and this graph sort of su@@ ms up what the problem is .
the Dem@@ oc@@ rats , they say , well , this isn &apos;t a big deal .
we can just raise ta@@ xes a bit and close that ga@@ p , especially if we raise ta@@ xes on the rich .
the Republi@@ cans say , he@@ y , no , no , we &apos;ve got a better idea .
why don &apos;t we lower both lines ?
why don &apos;t we lower government spending and lower government ta@@ xes , and then we &apos;ll be on an even more favor@@ able long @-@ term de@@ fic@@ it tra@@ je@@ ct@@ ory ?
and behind this powerful dis@@ agre@@ ement between how to close that ga@@ p , there &apos;s the worst kind of cy@@ ni@@ cal party politics , the worst kind of in@@ si@@ der bas@@ e@@ ball , lob@@ b@@ ying , all of that stuff , but there &apos;s also this power@@ fully interesting , respe@@ ct@@ ful dis@@ agre@@ ement between two fundament@@ ally different economic philosop@@ hi@@ es .
and I like to think , when I picture how Republi@@ cans see the economy , what I picture is just some ama@@ z@@ ingly well @-@ engine@@ ered machine , some perfect machine .
and this view gener@@ ally belie@@ ves that there is a role for government , a small role , to set the rules so people aren &apos;t lying and che@@ ating and hur@@ ting each other , maybe , you know , have a police force and a fire de@@ partment and an ar@@ my , but to have a very limited reach into the mechan@@ is@@ ms of this mach@@ in@@ ery .
and when I picture how Dem@@ oc@@ rats and Dem@@ oc@@ ra@@ tic @-@ le@@ an@@ ing econom@@ ists picture this economy , most Dem@@ oc@@ ra@@ tic econom@@ ists are , you know , they &apos;re capit@@ alists , they believe , yes , that &apos;s a good system a lot of the time .
it &apos;s good to let markets move resources to their more produc@@ tive use .
but that system has tons of problems .
wealth pil@@ es up in the wrong places .
wealth is ri@@ pped away from people who shouldn &apos;t be called un@@ produc@@ tive .
that &apos;s not going to create an equ@@ itable , fair society .
that machine doesn &apos;t care about the environment , about ra@@ c@@ ism , about all these issues that make this life worse for all of us , and so the government does have a role to take resources from more produc@@ tive uses , or from ri@@ cher sources , and give them to other sources .
and when you think about the economy through these two different len@@ ses , you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve , because the worse the crisis gets , the higher the st@@ ak@@ es are , the more each side thinks they know the answer and the other side is just going to ru@@ in everything .
and I can get really des@@ pa@@ ir@@ ing . I &apos;ve spent a lot of the last few years really depres@@ sed about this , until this year , I learned something that I felt really excited about . I feel like it &apos;s really good news , and it &apos;s so sho@@ cking , I don &apos;t like saying it , because I think people won &apos;t believe me .
but here &apos;s what I learned .
the American people , taken as a whole , when it comes to these issues , to fis@@ cal issues , are moder@@ ate , pra@@ g@@ matic cent@@ ris@@ ts .
and I know that &apos;s hard to believe , that the American people are moder@@ ate , pra@@ g@@ matic cent@@ ris@@ ts .
but let me explain what I &apos;m thinking .
when you look at how the fe@@ der@@ al government sp@@ ends money , so this is the b@@ attle right here , 5@@ 5 percent , more than half , is on So@@ cial S@@ ec@@ uri@@ ty , Medi@@ care , Medi@@ ca@@ id , a few other health programs , 20 percent de@@ fen@@ se , 19 percent dis@@ cre@@ tion@@ ary , and six percent interest .
so when we &apos;re talking about cutting government spending , this is the p@@ ie we &apos;re talking about , and Americans over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ingly , and it doesn &apos;t matter what party they &apos;re in , over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ingly like that big 5@@ 5 percent ch@@ unk .
they like So@@ cial S@@ ec@@ uri@@ ty . they like Medi@@ care .
they even like Medi@@ ca@@ id , even though that goes to the poor and in@@ dig@@ ent , which you might think would have less support .
and they do not want it fundament@@ ally tou@@ ched , although the American people are re@@ mark@@ ably comfortable , and Dem@@ oc@@ rats roughly equal to Republi@@ cans , with some min@@ or t@@ wea@@ ks to make the system more st@@ able .
social S@@ ec@@ uri@@ ty is fairly easy to fix .
the ru@@ mor@@ s of its de@@ mis@@ e are always gre@@ at@@ ly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
so gradu@@ ally raise So@@ cial S@@ ec@@ uri@@ ty re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment age , maybe only on people not yet born .
Americans are about 50 / 50 , whether they &apos;re Dem@@ oc@@ rats or Republi@@ cans .
reduce Medi@@ care for very we@@ al@@ thy sen@@ i@@ ors , sen@@ i@@ ors who make a lot of money . don &apos;t even elimin@@ ate it . just reduce it .
people gener@@ ally are comfortable with it , Dem@@ oc@@ rats and Republi@@ cans .
raise medical health care contribu@@ tions ?
everyone hat@@ es that equ@@ ally , but Republi@@ cans and Dem@@ oc@@ rats hate that together .
and so what this tells me is , when you look at the discus@@ sion of how to resol@@ ve our fis@@ cal problems , we are not a nation that &apos;s power@@ fully divi@@ ded on the major , major issue .
we &apos;re comfortable with it nee@@ ding some t@@ wea@@ ks , but we want to keep it .
we &apos;re not open to a discus@@ sion of elimin@@ ating it .
now there is one issue that is h@@ yp@@ er @-@ par@@ tis@@ an , and where there is one party that is just spend , spend , spend , we don &apos;t care , spend some more , and that of course is Republi@@ cans when it comes to military de@@ fen@@ se spending .
they way out@@ wei@@ gh Dem@@ oc@@ rats .
the vast majority want to protect military de@@ fen@@ se spending .
that &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , and that pres@@ ents a more difficult issue .
I should also note that the &#91; dis@@ cre@@ tion@@ ary &#93; spending , which is about 19 percent of the budget , that is Dem@@ oc@@ ra@@ tic and Republi@@ can issues , so you do have wel@@ f@@ are , food st@@ amp@@ s , other programs that tend to be popular among Dem@@ oc@@ rats , but you also have the farm bil@@ l and all sorts of De@@ partment of Inter@@ ior in@@ duc@@ ements for oil dri@@ ll@@ ing and other things , which tend to be popular among Republi@@ cans .
now when it comes to ta@@ xes , there is more dis@@ agre@@ ement .
that &apos;s a more par@@ tis@@ an area .
you have Dem@@ oc@@ rats over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ingly suppor@@ tive of rais@@ ing the income ta@@ x on people who make 2@@ 50,000 dollars a year , Republi@@ cans sort of against it , although if you break it out by income , Republi@@ cans who make less than 7@@ 5,000 dollars a year like this idea .
so basically Republi@@ cans who make more than 2@@ 50,000 dollars a year don &apos;t want to be ta@@ x@@ ed .
rais@@ ing ta@@ xes on investment income , you also see about two thir@@ ds of Dem@@ oc@@ rats but only one third of Republi@@ cans are comfortable with that idea .
this brings up a really important point , which is that we tend in this country to talk about Dem@@ oc@@ rats and Republi@@ cans and think there &apos;s this little group over there called in@@ depen@@ dents that &apos;s , what , two percent ?
if you add Dem@@ oc@@ rats , you add Republi@@ cans , you &apos;ve got the American people .
but that is not the case at all .
and it has not been the case for most of modern American history .
roughly a third of Americans say that they are Dem@@ oc@@ rats .
around a quar@@ ter say that they are Republi@@ cans .
a tiny little sli@@ ver call themselves liber@@ t@@ ari@@ ans , or soci@@ alists , or some other small third party , and the largest block , 40 percent , say they &apos;re in@@ depen@@ dents .
so most Americans are not par@@ tis@@ an , and most of the people in the independent c@@ amp fall somewhere in between , so even though we have tremendous over@@ la@@ p between the views on these fis@@ cal issues of Dem@@ oc@@ rats and Republi@@ cans , we have even more over@@ la@@ p when you add in the in@@ depen@@ dents .
now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues .
we get to hate each other on gun control and abor@@ tion and the environment , but on these fis@@ cal issues , these important fis@@ cal issues , we just are not anywhere nearly as divi@@ ded as people say .
and in fact , there &apos;s this other group of people who are not as divi@@ ded as people might think , and that group is econom@@ ists .
I talk to a lot of econom@@ ists , and back in the &apos; 7@@ 0s and &apos; 8@@ 0s it was ug@@ ly being an econom@@ ist .
you were in what they called the s@@ al@@ t@@ water c@@ amp , meaning Harvard , Prin@@ c@@ et@@ on , MIT , Stanford , Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey , or you were in the fres@@ h@@ water c@@ amp , University of Chicago , University of Ro@@ ches@@ ter .
you were a free market capit@@ alist econom@@ ist or you were a K@@ ey@@ nes@@ ian liber@@ al econom@@ ist , and these people didn &apos;t go to each other &apos;s we@@ dd@@ ings , they s@@ nu@@ b@@ bed each other at con@@ fer@@ ences .
it &apos;s still ug@@ ly to this day , but in my experience , it is really , really hard to find an econom@@ ist under 40 who still has that kind of way of seeing the world .
the vast majority of econom@@ ists -- it is so un@@ cool to call yourself an ide@@ ol@@ og@@ ue of either c@@ amp .
the p@@ hr@@ ase that you want , if you &apos;re a graduate student or a pos@@ t@@ do@@ c or you &apos;re a professor , a 3@@ 8 @-@ year @-@ old economics professor , is , &quot; I &apos;m an em@@ pi@@ ri@@ c@@ ist .
I go by the data . &quot;
and the data is very clear .
none of these major the@@ ories have been completely successful .
the 20th century , the last hundred years , is ri@@ dd@@ led with dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous examples of times that one school or the other tried to explain the past or predict the future and just did an awful , awful job , so the economics profes@@ sion has ac@@ quired some degree of mo@@ des@@ ty .
they still are an aw@@ fully ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant group of people , I will ass@@ ure you , but they &apos;re now ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant about their im@@ par@@ ti@@ ality , and they , too , see a tremendous range of potential out@@ comes .
and this non@@ par@@ tis@@ ans@@ hi@@ p is something that exists , that has exis@@ ted in secret in America for years and years and years .
I &apos;ve spent a lot of the fall talking to the three major organizations that sur@@ vey American political at@@ titu@@ des : Pe@@ w Res@@ ear@@ ch , the University of Chicago &apos;s National O@@ p@@ ini@@ on Res@@ ear@@ ch Center , and the most important but the least known is the American National Ele@@ ction S@@ tu@@ dies group that is the world &apos;s lon@@ gest , most respe@@ cted pol@@ l of political at@@ titu@@ des .
they &apos;ve been doing it since 194@@ 8 , and what they show cons@@ ist@@ ently throughout is that it &apos;s almost impossible to find Americans who are cons@@ ist@@ ent ide@@ ologi@@ cally , who cons@@ ist@@ ently support , &quot; No we mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t ta@@ x , and we must li@@ mit the size of government , &quot; or , &quot; No , we must encoura@@ ge government to play a larger role in re@@ distribution and cor@@ rec@@ ting the ills of capit@@ alism . &quot;
those groups are very , very small .
the vast majority of people , they pick and choose , they see com@@ promise and they change over time when they hear a better argument or a worse argument .
and that part of it has not changed .
what has changed is how people respond to v@@ ag@@ ue questions .
if you ask people v@@ ag@@ ue questions , like , &quot; D@@ o you think there should be more government or less government ? &quot;
&quot; do you think government should &quot; - especially if you use lo@@ aded language -- &quot; D@@ o you think the government should provide hand@@ ou@@ ts ? &quot;
or , &quot; D@@ o you think the government should re@@ distribu@@ te ? &quot;
then you can see radical par@@ tis@@ an change .
but when you get specific , when you actually ask about the actual ta@@ x@@ ing and spending issues under consi@@ der@@ ation , people are re@@ mark@@ ably cent@@ r@@ ist , they &apos;re re@@ mark@@ ably open to com@@ promise .
so what we have , then , when you think about the fis@@ cal cli@@ ff , don &apos;t think of it as the American people fundament@@ ally can &apos;t stand each other on these issues and that we must be ri@@ pped apart into two separate war@@ ring nations .
think of it as a tiny , tiny number of ancient econom@@ ists and mis@@ repres@@ ent@@ ative ide@@ ol@@ og@@ ues have cap@@ tured the process .
and they &apos;ve cap@@ tured the process through familiar ways , through a primar@@ y system which encoura@@ ges that small group of people &apos;s voices , because that small group of people , the people who answer all y@@ es@@ es or all no@@ es on those ide@@ ological questions , they might be small but every one of them has a blo@@ g , every one of them has been on Fo@@ x or M@@ S@@ N@@ BC in the last week .
every one of them becomes a l@@ ou@@ der and l@@ ou@@ der voice , but they don &apos;t represent us .
they don &apos;t represent what our views are .
and that gets me back to the dollar , and it gets me back to re@@ min@@ ding myself that we know this experience .
we know what it &apos;s like to have these people on TV , in Con@@ gress , y@@ elling about how the end of the world is coming if we don &apos;t adop@@ t their view completely , because it &apos;s happened about the dollar ever since there &apos;s been a dollar .
we had the b@@ attle between J@@ eff@@ er@@ son and H@@ am@@ il@@ ton .
in 19@@ 13 , we had this ug@@ ly b@@ attle over the Fe@@ der@@ al Res@@ erve , when it was created , with vi@@ cious , an@@ gry argum@@ ents over how it would be con@@ stitu@@ ted , and a general agre@@ ement that the way it was con@@ stitu@@ ted was the worst possible com@@ promise , a com@@ promise gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to destro@@ y this valu@@ able thing , this dollar , but then everyone agre@@ e@@ in@@ g , okay , so long as we &apos;re on the gold standard , it should be okay .
the F@@ ed can &apos;t m@@ ess it up so b@@ ad@@ ly .
but then we got off the gold standard for individuals during the D@@ ep@@ res@@ sion and we got off the gold standard as a source of international cur@@ ren@@ cy co@@ ordin@@ ation during Richard Ni@@ x@@ on &apos;s pres@@ iden@@ cy .
each of those times , we were on the ver@@ ge of complete collap@@ se .
and nothing happened at all .
throughout it all , the dollar has been one of the most long @-@ standing , st@@ able , reas@@ on@@ able cur@@ ren@@ cies , and we all use it every single day , no matter what the people scre@@ aming about tell us , no matter how scar@@ ed we &apos;re supposed to be .
and this long @-@ term fis@@ cal picture that we &apos;re in right now , I think what is most ma@@ d@@ den@@ ing about it is , if Con@@ gress were simply able to show not that they agree with each other , not that they &apos;re able to come up with the best possible com@@ promise , but that they are able to just begin the process towards com@@ promise , we all inst@@ antly are better off .
the fear is that the world is watching .
the fear is that the longer we del@@ ay any solution , the more the world will look to the U.@@ S .
not as the be@@ dro@@ ck of st@@ ability in the global economy , but as a place that can &apos;t resol@@ ve its own fi@@ ghts , and the longer we put that off , the more we make the world nervous , the higher interest rates are going to be , the qui@@ ck@@ er we &apos;re going to have to face a day of horri@@ ble cal@@ am@@ ity .
and so just the act of com@@ promise itself , and susta@@ ined , real com@@ promise , would give us even more time , would allow both sides even longer to spread out the pain and reach even more com@@ promise down the road .
but the more we address it as a practical conc@@ ern , the so@@ on@@ er we can resol@@ ve it , and the more time we have to resol@@ ve it , para@@ do@@ x@@ ically .
thank you .
Adam D@@ avi@@ d@@ son : what we learned from te@@ e@@ ter@@ ing on the fis@@ cal cli@@ ff
at the end of 20@@ 12 , the U@@ S political system was head@@ ed for the &quot; fis@@ cal cli@@ ff &quot; -- a budget im@@ pas@@ se that could only be solved with bi@@ par@@ tis@@ an agre@@ ement . Adam D@@ avi@@ d@@ son , co@@ h@@ ost of &quot; P@@ lan@@ et Mon@@ ey , &quot; shares surprising data on how bi@@ par@@ tis@@ an we truly are -- and hin@@ ts at the dis@@ connect between repres@@ ent@@ atives and the people they represent .
when I was little -- and by the way , I was little once -- my father told me a story about an 18@@ th century wat@@ ch@@ maker .
and what this guy had done : he used to produce these f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ously beautiful wat@@ ches .
and one day , one of his custom@@ ers came into his work@@ shop and asked him to clean the watch that he &apos;d bought .
and the guy took it apart , and one of the things he pul@@ led out was one of the balance whe@@ els .
and as he did so , his custom@@ er noticed that on the back side of the balance whe@@ el was an en@@ gra@@ ving , were words .
and he said to the guy , &quot; Why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see ? &quot;
and the wat@@ ch@@ maker turned around and said , &quot; God can see it . &quot;
now I &apos;m not in the least bit religious , nei@@ ther was my father , but at that point , I noticed something happening here .
I felt something in this ple@@ x@@ us of blood ves@@ sel@@ s and ner@@ ves , and there must be some mus@@ cles in there as well somewhere , I guess .
but I felt something .
and it was a physi@@ ological response .
and from that point on , from my age at the time , I began to think of things in a different way .
and as I took on my career as a designer , I began to ask myself the simple question : do we actually think beauty , or do we feel it ?
now you probably know the answer to this already .
you probably think , well , I don &apos;t know which one you think it is , but I think it &apos;s about feeling beauty .
and so I then moved on into my design career and began to find some exciting things .
one of the most early work was done in autom@@ o@@ tive design -- some very exciting work was done there .
and during a lot of this work , we found something , or I found something , that really fascin@@ ated me , and maybe you can remember it .
do you remember when lights used to just go on and off , cli@@ ck cli@@ ck , when you closed the door in a car ?
and then somebody , I think it was B@@ M@@ W , introduc@@ ed a light that went out slowly .
remember that ?
I remember it clearly .
do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that ?
I remember sitting there thinking , this is fantastic .
in fact , I &apos;ve never found anybody that doesn &apos;t like the light that goes out slowly .
I thought , well what the hell &apos;s that about ?
so I started to ask myself questions about it .
and the first was , I &apos;d ask other people : &quot; do you like it ? &quot; &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; and they &apos;d say , &quot; Oh , it feels so natural , &quot; or , &quot; It &apos;s nice . &quot;
I thought , well that &apos;s not good enough .
can we cut down a little bit further , because , as a designer , I need the voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary , I need the ke@@ y@@ board , of how this actually works .
and so I did some experiments .
and I suddenly realized that there was something that did exactly that -- light to dark in six seconds -- exactly that .
do you know what it is ? anyone ?
you see , using this bit , the thin@@ ky bit , the slow bit of the brain -- using that .
and this isn &apos;t a think , it &apos;s a feel .
and would you do me a fa@@ vor ?
for the next 14 minutes or whatever it is , will you feel stuff ?
I don &apos;t need you to think so much as I want you to feel it .
I felt a sense of rel@@ ax@@ ation temper@@ ed with an@@ ticip@@ ation .
and that thing that I found was the cin@@ em@@ a or the theater .
it &apos;s actually just happened here -- light to dark in six seconds .
and when that happens , are you sitting there going , &quot; No , the movie &apos;s about to start , &quot; or are you going , &quot; That &apos;s fantastic . I &apos;m looking forward to it .
I get a sense of an@@ ticip@@ ation &quot; ?
now I &apos;m not a neuros@@ ci@@ enti@@ st .
I don &apos;t know even if there is something called a condi@@ tioned refle@@ x .
but it might be .
because the people I speak to in the nor@@ thern h@@ emis@@ p@@ here that used to go in the cin@@ em@@ a get this .
and some of the people I speak to that have never seen a movie or been to the theater don &apos;t get it in the same way .
everybody li@@ kes it , but some like it more than others .
so this leads me to think of this in a different way .
we &apos;re not feeling it . we &apos;re thinking beauty is in the lim@@ bi@@ c system -- if that &apos;s not an out@@ mo@@ ded idea .
these are the bits , the pleasure cen@@ ters , and maybe what I &apos;m seeing and sen@@ sing and feeling is by@@ pas@@ sing my thinking .
the wir@@ ing from your sens@@ ory appar@@ at@@ us to those bits is shor@@ ter than the bits that have to pass through the thin@@ ky bit , the cortex .
they arri@@ ve first .
so how do we make that actually work ?
and how much of that re@@ active side of it is due to what we already know , or what we &apos;re going to learn , about something ?
this is one of the most beautiful things I know .
it &apos;s a plastic ba@@ g .
and when I looked at it first , I thought , no , there &apos;s no beauty in that .
then I found out , post ex@@ pos@@ ure , that this plastic ba@@ g if I put it into a fil@@ thy pu@@ dd@@ le or a stream filled with co@@ li@@ forms and all sorts of dis@@ gu@@ sting stuff , that that fil@@ thy water will mig@@ rate through the wall of the ba@@ g by os@@ mos@@ is and end up inside it as p@@ ure , pot@@ able drin@@ king water .
and all of a sudden , this plastic ba@@ g was extremely beautiful to me .
now I &apos;m going to ask you again to swit@@ ch on the emotional bit .
would you mind taking the brain out , and I just want you to feel something .
look at that . what are you feeling about it ?
is it beautiful ? is it exciting ?
I &apos;m watching your faces very car@@ efully .
there &apos;s some rather bor@@ ed @-@ looking gentle@@ men and some slightly eng@@ aged @-@ looking la@@ dies who are pi@@ cking up something off that .
maybe there &apos;s an in@@ no@@ c@@ ence to it .
now I &apos;m going to tell you what it is . are you ready ?
this is the last act on this Earth of a little girl called H@@ ei@@ di , five years old , before she died of cancer to the sp@@ ine .
it &apos;s the last thing she did , the last physical act .
look at that picture .
look at the in@@ no@@ c@@ ence . look at the beauty in it .
is it beautiful now ?
stop . stop . how do you feel ?
where are you feeling this ?
I &apos;m feeling it here . I feel it here .
and I &apos;m watching your faces , because your faces are telling me something .
the lad@@ y over there is actually cr@@ ying , by the way .
but what are you doing ?
I watch what people do .
I watch faces .
I watch re@@ actions .
because I have to know how people re@@ act to things .
and one of the most common faces on something fac@@ ed with beauty , something stu@@ pe@@ f@@ y@@ ingly del@@ ici@@ ous , is what I call the O@@ M@@ G .
and by the way , there &apos;s no pleasure in that face .
it &apos;s not a &quot; this is wonderful ! &quot;
the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws are doing this , the eyes are de@@ focused , and the mouth is han@@ ging open .
that &apos;s not the expression of joy .
there &apos;s something else in that .
there &apos;s something weird happening .
so pleasure seems to be temper@@ ed by a whole series of different things coming in .
po@@ ig@@ nan@@ cy is a word I love as a designer .
it means something tri@@ g@@ ger@@ ing a big emotional response , often quite a sad emotional response , but it &apos;s part of what we do .
it isn &apos;t just about nice .
and this is the di@@ le@@ mma , this is the para@@ do@@ x , of beauty .
Sen@@ s@@ ori@@ ly , we &apos;re taking in all sorts of things -- mix@@ tures of things that are good , bad , exciting , fri@@ gh@@ tening -- to come up with that sens@@ ori@@ al ex@@ pos@@ ure , that sen@@ sation of what &apos;s going on .
Pa@@ th@@ os appe@@ ars obviously as part of what you just saw in that little girl &apos;s drawing .
and also tri@@ ump@@ h , this sense of trans@@ cen@@ dence , this &quot; I never knew that . Ah , this is something new . &quot;
and that &apos;s pac@@ ked in there as well .
and as we assem@@ ble these tools , from a design point of view , I get terri@@ bly excited about it , because these are things , as we &apos;ve already said , they &apos;re arri@@ ving at the brain , it would seem , before c@@ og@@ ni@@ tion , before we can mani@@ pul@@ ate them -- electro@@ chemical party tri@@ cks .
now what I &apos;m also interested in is : is it possible to separate in@@ trin@@ si@@ c and ex@@ trin@@ si@@ c beauty ?
by that , I mean in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally beautiful things , just something that &apos;s ex@@ qu@@ is@@ it@@ ely beautiful , that &apos;s univers@@ ally beautiful .
very hard to find . maybe you &apos;ve got some examples of it .
very hard to find something that , to everybody , is a very beautiful thing , without a certain amount of information pac@@ ked in there before .
so a lot of it ten@@ ds to be ex@@ trin@@ si@@ c .
it &apos;s medi@@ ated by information before the comp@@ re@@ hen@@ sion .
or the information &apos;s ad@@ ded on at the back , like that little girl &apos;s drawing that I showed you .
now when talking about beauty you can &apos;t get away from the fact that a lot experiments have been done in this way with faces and what have you .
and one of the most te@@ di@@ ous ones , I think , was saying that beauty was about symmet@@ ry .
well it obviously isn &apos;t .
this is a more interesting one where half faces were shown to some people , and then to add them into a list of most beautiful to least beautiful and then ex@@ pos@@ ing a full face .
and they found that it was almost ex@@ act co@@ inci@@ dence .
so it wasn &apos;t about symmet@@ ry .
in fact , this lad@@ y has a particularly as@@ y@@ mm@@ et@@ ri@@ cal face , of which both sides are beautiful .
but they &apos;re both different .
and as a designer , I can &apos;t help me@@ dd@@ ling with this , so I pul@@ led it to bits and sort of did stuff like this , and tried to understand what the individual elements were , but feeling it as I go .
now I can feel a sen@@ sation of deli@@ ght and beauty if I look at that eye .
I &apos;m not getting it off the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ w .
and the ear@@ hole isn &apos;t doing it to me at all .
so I don &apos;t know how much this is helping me , but it &apos;s helping to gui@@ de me to the places where the signals are coming off .
and as I say , I &apos;m not a neuros@@ ci@@ enti@@ st , but to understand how I can start to assem@@ ble things that will very quickly b@@ yp@@ ass this thinking part and get me to the enjo@@ y@@ able pre@@ cognitive elements .
A@@ na@@ is N@@ in and the T@@ al@@ mu@@ d have told us time and time again that we see things not as they are , but as we are .
so I &apos;m going to sh@@ am@@ el@@ ess@@ ly exp@@ ose something to you , which is beautiful to me .
and this is the F@@ 1 M@@ V A@@ gu@@ st@@ a .
it is really -- I mean , I can &apos;t expres@@ s to you how ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te this object is .
but I also know why it &apos;s ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te to me , because it &apos;s a pal@@ imp@@ s@@ est of things .
it &apos;s m@@ asses and m@@ asses of la@@ yers .
this is just the bit that pro@@ tru@@ des into our physical dimen@@ sion .
it &apos;s something much bigger .
layer after layer of le@@ gen@@ d , sport , details that res@@ onate .
I mean , if I just go through some of them now -- I know about lam@@ in@@ ar flow when it comes to air @-@ pi@@ er@@ cing objects , and that does it consum@@ mat@@ ely well , you can see it can .
so that &apos;s getting me excited .
and I feel that here .
this bit , the big secret of autom@@ o@@ tive design -- refle@@ ction management .
it &apos;s not about the shapes , it &apos;s how the shapes refle@@ ct light .
now that thing , light fli@@ ck@@ ers across it as you move , so it becomes a kin@@ e@@ tic object , even though it &apos;s standing still -- managed by how bri@@ l@@ li@@ antly that &apos;s done on the refle@@ ction .
this little rel@@ ief on the foot@@ plate , by the way , to a ri@@ der means there &apos;s something going on underneath it -- in this case , a drive chain running at 300 miles and hour probably , taking the power from the engine .
I &apos;m getting terri@@ bly excited as my mind and my eyes fli@@ ck across these things .
ti@@ tan@@ ium l@@ acqu@@ er on this .
I can &apos;t tell you how wonderful this is .
that &apos;s how you stop the nu@@ ts coming off at high speed on the whe@@ el .
I &apos;m really getting into this now .
and of course , a ra@@ cing bi@@ ke doesn &apos;t have a pro@@ p stand , but this one , because it &apos;s a road bi@@ ke , it all goes away and it fol@@ ds into this little ga@@ p .
so it disappe@@ ars .
and then I can &apos;t tell you how hard it is to do that radi@@ ator , which is cur@@ ved .
why would you do that ?
because I know we need to bring the whe@@ el far@@ ther into the a@@ ero@@ dynam@@ ics .
so it &apos;s more expensive , but it &apos;s wonderful .
and to ca@@ p it all , brand ro@@ y@@ al@@ ty -- A@@ gu@@ st@@ a , Coun@@ t A@@ gu@@ st@@ a , from the great hist@@ ories of this stuff .
the bit that you can &apos;t see is the geni@@ us that created this .
they call him &quot; The P@@ l@@ um@@ ber &quot; in Ital@@ y , as well as &quot; Ma@@ es@@ tr@@ o , &quot; because he actually is engineer and cra@@ f@@ ts@@ man and sculp@@ tor at the same time .
there &apos;s so little com@@ promise on this , you can &apos;t see it .
but unfortunately , the li@@ kes of me and people that are like me have to deal with com@@ promise all the time with beauty .
we have to deal with it .
so I have to work with a supply chain , and I &apos;ve got to work with the technologies , and I &apos;ve got to work with everything else all the time , and so com@@ promis@@ es start to fit into it .
and so look at her .
I &apos;ve had to make a bit of a com@@ promise there .
I &apos;ve had to move that part across , but only a milli@@ meter .
no one &apos;s noticed , have they yet ?
did you see what I did ?
I moved three things by a milli@@ meter .
pretty ? yes .
beautiful ? maybe less@@ er .
but then , of course , the consu@@ mer says that doesn &apos;t really matter .
so that &apos;s okay , isn &apos;t it ?
another milli@@ meter ?
no one &apos;s going to notice those sp@@ lit lines and changes .
it &apos;s that easy to lose beauty , because beauty &apos;s incredibly difficult to do .
and only a few people can do it .
and a focus group cannot do it .
and a team r@@ ar@@ ely can do it .
it takes a central cortex , if you like , to be able to or@@ ches@@ tra@@ te all those elements at the same time .
this is a beautiful water bot@@ tle -- some of you know of it -- done by Ros@@ s Lo@@ ve@@ gro@@ ve , the designer .
this is pretty close to in@@ trin@@ si@@ c beauty . this one , as long as you know what water is like then you can experience this .
it &apos;s lo@@ vely because it is an em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of something re@@ fres@@ hing and del@@ ici@@ ous .
I might like it more than you like it , because I know how bloo@@ dy hard it is to do it .
it &apos;s stu@@ pe@@ f@@ y@@ ingly difficult to make something that re@@ fra@@ cts light like that , that comes out of the tool cor@@ rec@@ tly , that goes down the line without fall@@ ing over .
underneath this , like the story of the s@@ w@@ an , is a million things very difficult to do .
so all ha@@ il to that .
it &apos;s a fantastic example , a simple object .
and the one I showed you before was , of course , a mas@@ si@@ vely complex one .
and they &apos;re working in beauty in slightly different ways because of it .
you all , I guess , like me , enjoy watching a bal@@ let dan@@ cer dance .
and part of the joy of it is , you know the diffic@@ ul@@ ty .
you also may be taking into account the fact that it &apos;s incredibly pain@@ ful .
anybody seen a bal@@ let dan@@ cer &apos;s to@@ es when they come out of the points ?
while she &apos;s doing these gra@@ c@@ eful ar@@ ab@@ es@@ qu@@ es and pli@@ es and what have you , something horri@@ ble &apos;s going on down here .
the comp@@ re@@ hen@@ sion of it leads us to a greater and hei@@ gh@@ tened sense of the beauty of what &apos;s actually going on .
now I &apos;m using micros@@ econ@@ ds w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly here , so please ignor@@ e me .
but what I have to do now , feeling again , what I &apos;ve got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enz@@ y@@ mes , of these tri@@ gg@@ ers into something early on in the process , that you pick it up , not through your thinking , but through your feeling .
so we &apos;re going to have a little experiment .
right , are you ready ? I &apos;m going to show you something for a very , very b@@ rief moment .
are you ready ? okay .
did you think that was a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle when I showed it to you at the first flas@@ h ?
it &apos;s not .
tell me something , did you think it was quick when you first saw it ? yes you did .
did you think it was modern ? yes you did .
that bli@@ p , that information , shot into you before that .
and because your brain star@@ ter motor began there , now it &apos;s got to deal with it .
and the great thing is , this mot@@ or@@ cycle has been st@@ y@@ led this way specifically to en@@ gender a sense that it &apos;s green technology and it &apos;s good for you and it &apos;s light and it &apos;s all part of the future .
so is that wrong ?
well in this case it isn &apos;t , because it &apos;s a very , very ec@@ ologi@@ cally @-@ sound piece of technology .
but you &apos;re a sla@@ ve of that first flas@@ h .
we are sla@@ ves to the first few fra@@ ctions of a second -- and that &apos;s where much of my work has to win or lose , on a shel@@ f in a shop .
it w@@ ins or los@@ es at that point .
you may see 50 , 100 , 200 things on a shel@@ f as you walk down it , but I have to work within that dom@@ ain , to en@@ sure that it gets you there first .
and finally , the layer that I love , of knowledge .
some of you , I &apos;m sure , will be familiar with this .
what &apos;s incredible about this , and the way I love to come back to it , is this is taking something that you hate or bor@@ es you , fol@@ ding clo@@ th@@ es , and if you can actually do this -- who can actually do this ? anybody try to do this ?
yeah ?
it &apos;s fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
look at that . do you want to see it again ?
no time . it says I have two minutes left , so we can &apos;t do this .
but just go to the Web , YouTube , pull it down , &quot; fol@@ ding T @-@ shi@@ rt . &quot;
that &apos;s how under@@ paid yo@@ unger @-@ aged people have to fold your T @-@ shi@@ rt .
you didn &apos;t maybe know it .
but how do you feel about it ?
it feels fantastic when you do it , you look forward to doing it , and when you tell somebody else about it -- like you probably have -- you look really smart .
the knowledge bu@@ bble that si@@ ts around the outside , the stuff that costs nothing , because that knowledge is free -- b@@ und@@ le that together and where do we come out ?
form follo@@ ws function ?
only sometimes . only sometimes .
form is function . form is function .
it in@@ forms , it tells us , it supp@@ lies us answers before we &apos;ve even thought about it .
and so I &apos;ve stopped using words like &quot; form , &quot; and I &apos;ve stopped using words like &quot; function &quot; as a designer .
what I try to pur@@ sue now is the emotional func@@ tion@@ ality of things .
because if I can get that right , I can make them wonderful , and I can make them repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly wonderful .
and you know what those products and services are , because you own some of them .
they &apos;re the things that you &apos;d s@@ n@@ at@@ ch if the house was on fire .
forming the emotional b@@ ond between this thing and you is an electro@@ chemical party trick that happens before you even think about it .
thank you very much .
Richard Se@@ y@@ m@@ our : how beauty feels
a story , a work of art , a face , a designed object -- how do we tell that something is beautiful ? and why does it matter so much to us ? designer Richard Se@@ y@@ m@@ our explor@@ es our response to beauty and the surprising power of objects that exhi@@ bit it .
one of the most common ways of divi@@ ding the world is into those who believe and those who don &apos;t -- into the religious and the a@@ thei@@ sts .
and for the last decade or so , it &apos;s been quite clear what being an a@@ thei@@ st means .
there have been some very vo@@ cal a@@ thei@@ sts who &apos;ve poin@@ ted out , not just that religion is wrong , but that it &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
these people , many of whom have lived in North Oxford , have argu@@ ed -- they &apos;ve argu@@ ed that belie@@ ving in God is ak@@ in to belie@@ ving in fa@@ i@@ ries and essentially that the whole thing is a ch@@ il@@ dis@@ h game .
now I think it &apos;s too easy .
I think it &apos;s too easy to dis@@ mis@@ s the whole of religion that way .
and it &apos;s as easy as sho@@ ot@@ ing fish in a bar@@ re@@ l .
and what I &apos;d like to in@@ au@@ g@@ ur@@ ate today is a new way of being an a@@ thei@@ st -- if you like , a new version of a@@ thei@@ s@@ m we could call A@@ thei@@ s@@ m 2.@@ 0 .
now what is A@@ thei@@ s@@ m 2.@@ 0 ?
well it starts from a very basic pre@@ mis@@ e : of course , there &apos;s no God .
of course , there are no d@@ ei@@ ties or super@@ natural spiri@@ ts or an@@ gel@@ s , etc .
now let &apos;s move on ; that &apos;s not the end of the story , that &apos;s the very , very beginning .
I &apos;m interested in the kind of con@@ stitu@@ ency that thinks something along these lines : that thinks , &quot; I can &apos;t believe in any of this stuff .
I can &apos;t believe in the do@@ c@@ tr@@ ines .
I don &apos;t think these do@@ c@@ tr@@ ines are right .
but , &quot; a very important but , &quot; I love Christ@@ mas car@@ ols .
I really like the art of Man@@ te@@ g@@ na .
I really like looking at old ch@@ ur@@ ches .
I really like turning the pages of the O@@ l@@ d T@@ est@@ ament . &quot;
whatever it may be , you know the kind of thing I &apos;m talking about -- people who are attra@@ cted to the ri@@ tu@@ alis@@ tic side , the mor@@ alis@@ tic , commun@@ al side of religion , but can &apos;t bear the do@@ c@@ tr@@ ine .
until now , these people have fac@@ ed a rather un@@ pleas@@ ant choice .
it &apos;s almost as though either you acc@@ ept the do@@ c@@ tr@@ ine and then you can have all the nice stuff , or you re@@ ject the do@@ c@@ tr@@ ine and you &apos;re living in some kind of spiri@@ tual wa@@ st@@ el@@ and under the gui@@ dance of C@@ N@@ N and Wal@@ mar@@ t .
so that &apos;s a sort of tough choice .
I don &apos;t think we have to make that choice .
I think there is an alternative .
I think there are ways -- and I &apos;m being both very respe@@ ct@@ ful and completely im@@ pi@@ ous -- of ste@@ aling from religi@@ ons .
if you don &apos;t believe in a religion , there &apos;s nothing wrong with pi@@ cking and mix@@ ing , with taking out the best sides of religion .
and for me , a@@ thei@@ s@@ m 2.@@ 0 is about both , as I say , a respe@@ ct@@ ful and an im@@ pi@@ ous way of going through religi@@ ons and saying , &quot; What here could we use ? &quot;
the se@@ cular world is full of holes .
we have se@@ cul@@ ari@@ zed b@@ ad@@ ly , I would argue .
and a th@@ or@@ ough study of religion could give us all sorts of in@@ si@@ ghts into areas of life that are not going too well .
and I &apos;d like to run through a few of these today .
I &apos;d like to k@@ ick off by looking at education .
now education is a field the se@@ cular world really belie@@ ves in .
when we think about how we &apos;re going to make the world a better place , we think education ; that &apos;s where we put a lot of money .
education is going to give us , not only commercial skills , industrial skills , it &apos;s also going to make us better people .
you know the kind of thing a com@@ men@@ c@@ ement address is , and gradu@@ ation cer@@ em@@ on@@ ies , those ly@@ ri@@ cal cla@@ im@@ s that education , the process of education -- particularly higher education -- will make us into no@@ bl@@ er and better human beings .
that &apos;s a lo@@ vely idea .
interesting where it came from .
in the early 19@@ th century , ch@@ urch atten@@ dance in Western Europe started sli@@ ding down very , very shar@@ p@@ ly , and people p@@ ani@@ cked .
they asked themselves the following question .
they said , where are people going to find the mor@@ ality , where are they going to find gui@@ dance , and where are they going to find sources of con@@ sol@@ ation ?
and influ@@ ential voices came up with one answer .
they said culture .
it &apos;s to culture that we should look for gui@@ dance , for con@@ sol@@ ation , for mor@@ ality .
let &apos;s look to the pla@@ ys of Sha@@ k@@ es@@ pe@@ are , the di@@ alog@@ ues of Pla@@ to , the no@@ vels of J@@ ane Au@@ st@@ en .
in there , we &apos;ll find a lot of the tru@@ ths that we might previ@@ ously have found in the G@@ os@@ pe@@ l of Sa@@ int John .
now I think that &apos;s a very beautiful idea and a very true idea .
they wanted to re@@ place scri@@ p@@ ture with culture .
and that &apos;s a very pl@@ au@@ si@@ ble idea .
it &apos;s also an idea that we have for@@ gotten .
if you went to a top university -- let &apos;s say you went to Harvard or Oxford or Cambridge -- and you said , &quot; I &apos;ve come here because I &apos;m in search of mor@@ ality , gui@@ dance and con@@ sol@@ ation ; I want to know how to live , &quot; they would show you the way to the ins@@ ane as@@ yl@@ um .
this is simply not what our grand@@ est and best institu@@ tes of higher learning are in the business of .
why ? they don &apos;t think we need it .
they don &apos;t think we are in an ur@@ gent need of ass@@ ist@@ ance .
they see us as adults , rational adults .
what we need is information .
we need data , we don &apos;t need help .
now religi@@ ons start from a very different place indeed .
all religi@@ ons , all major religi@@ ons , at various points call us children .
and like children , they believe that we are in sever@@ e need of ass@@ ist@@ ance .
we &apos;re only just holding it together .
perhaps this is just me , maybe you .
but anyway , we &apos;re only just holding it together .
and we need help . of course , we need help .
and so we need gui@@ dance and we need di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic learning .
you know , in the 18@@ th century in the U.@@ K. , the greatest pre@@ ach@@ er , greatest religious pre@@ ach@@ er , was a man called John W@@ es@@ ley , who went up and down this country deli@@ vering ser@@ mon@@ s , ad@@ vis@@ ing people how they could live .
he deli@@ vered ser@@ mon@@ s on the du@@ ties of parents to their children and children to their parents , the du@@ ties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich .
he was trying to tell people how they should live through the medi@@ um of ser@@ mon@@ s , the classi@@ c medi@@ um of deli@@ very of religi@@ ons .
now we &apos;ve given up with the idea of ser@@ mon@@ s .
if you said to a modern liber@@ al individu@@ alist , &quot; Hey , how about a ser@@ m@@ on ? &quot;
they &apos;d go , &quot; No , no . I don &apos;t need one of those .
I &apos;m an independent , individual person . &quot;
what &apos;s the difference between a ser@@ m@@ on and our modern , se@@ cular mo@@ de of deli@@ very , the lec@@ ture ?
well a ser@@ m@@ on wants to change your life and a lec@@ ture wants to give you a bit of information .
and I think we need to get back to that ser@@ m@@ on tradi@@ tion .
the tradi@@ tion of ser@@ mon@@ i@@ zing is hu@@ gely valu@@ able , because we are in need of gui@@ dance , mor@@ ality and con@@ sol@@ ation -- and religi@@ ons know that .
another point about education : we tend to believe in the modern se@@ cular world that if you tell someone something once , they &apos;ll remember it .
sit them in a classroom , tell them about Pla@@ to at the age of 20 , send them out for a career in management cons@@ ul@@ tan@@ cy for 40 years , and that lesson will stick with them .
religi@@ ons go , &quot; N@@ on@@ sense .
you need to keep repe@@ ating the lesson 10 times a day .
so get on your k@@ ne@@ es and repe@@ at it . &quot;
that &apos;s what all religi@@ ons tell us : &quot; get on you k@@ ne@@ es and repe@@ at it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day . &quot;
otherwise our minds are like si@@ ev@@ es .
so religi@@ ons are cultures of re@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion .
they circle the great tru@@ ths again and again and again .
we associ@@ ate re@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion with bor@@ e@@ dom .
&quot; give us the new , &quot; we &apos;re always saying .
&quot; the new is better than the old . &quot;
if I said to you , &quot; Okay , we &apos;re not going to have new TED .
we &apos;re just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they &apos;re so true .
we &apos;re going to watch Eli@@ z@@ ab@@ eth G@@ il@@ bert five times because what she says is so clever , &quot; you &apos;d feel che@@ ated .
not so if you &apos;re adop@@ ting a religious min@@ d@@ set .
the other things that religi@@ ons do is to ar@@ range time .
all the major religi@@ ons give us cal@@ en@@ dar@@ s .
what is a cal@@ end@@ ar ?
a cal@@ end@@ ar is a way of making sure that across the year you will b@@ ump into certain very important ideas .
in the Ca@@ tho@@ lic chron@@ ology , Ca@@ tho@@ lic cal@@ end@@ ar , at the end of Mar@@ ch you will think about St@@ . Jer@@ ome and his quali@@ ties of hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ty and go@@ od@@ ness and his gener@@ osity to the poor .
you won &apos;t do that by accident ; you will do that because you are gui@@ ded to do that .
now we don &apos;t think that way .
in the se@@ cular world we think , &quot; If an idea is important , I &apos;ll b@@ ump into it .
I &apos;ll just come across it . &quot;
non@@ sense , says the religious world view .
religious view says we need cal@@ en@@ dar@@ s , we need to structure time , we need to syn@@ chron@@ ize en@@ counter@@ s .
this comes across also in the way in which religi@@ ons set up ri@@ tu@@ als around important feelings .
take the Mo@@ on . it &apos;s really important to look at the Mo@@ on .
you know , when you look at the Mo@@ on , you think , &quot; I &apos;m really small . what are my problems ? &quot;
it s@@ ets things into perspective , etc . , etc .
we should all look at the Mo@@ on a bit more often . we don &apos;t .
why don &apos;t we ? well there &apos;s nothing to tell us , &quot; Lo@@ ok at the Mo@@ on . &quot;
but if you &apos;re a Z@@ en Budd@@ h@@ ist in the middle of September , you will be or@@ dered out of your home , made to stand on a can@@ on@@ ical plat@@ form and made to celebra@@ te the fes@@ tiv@@ al of T@@ su@@ k@@ im@@ i , where you will be given po@@ em@@ s to read in hon@@ or of the Mo@@ on and the pas@@ sage of time and the fra@@ il@@ ty of life that it should re@@ mind us of .
you &apos;ll be hand@@ ed ri@@ ce c@@ ak@@ es .
and the Mo@@ on and the refle@@ ction on the Mo@@ on will have a se@@ cure place in your heart .
that &apos;s very good .
the other thing that religi@@ ons are really aware of is : speak well -- I &apos;m not doing a very good job of this here -- but or@@ atory , or@@ atory is absolutely key to religi@@ ons .
in the se@@ cular world , you can come through the university system and be a l@@ ous@@ y spea@@ ker and still have a great career .
but the religious world doesn &apos;t think that way .
what you &apos;re saying needs to be bac@@ ked up by a really convin@@ cing way of saying it .
so if you go to an African American P@@ ent@@ ecos@@ tal@@ ist ch@@ urch in the American South and you listen to how they talk , my go@@ od@@ ness , they talk well .
after every convin@@ cing point , people will go , &quot; A@@ men , am@@ en , am@@ en . &quot;
at the end of a really r@@ ous@@ ing par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h , they &apos;ll all stand up , and they &apos;ll go , &quot; Th@@ ank you J@@ es@@ us , thank you C@@ hr@@ ist , thank you Sa@@ vi@@ or . &quot;
if we were doing it like they do it -- let &apos;s not do it , but if we were to do it -- I would tell you something like , &quot; C@@ ul@@ ture should re@@ place scri@@ p@@ ture . &quot;
and you would go , &quot; A@@ men , am@@ en , am@@ en . &quot;
and at the end of my talk , you would all stand up and you would go , &quot; Th@@ ank you Pla@@ to , thank you Sha@@ k@@ es@@ pe@@ are , thank you J@@ ane Au@@ st@@ en . &quot;
and we &apos;d know that we had a real r@@ hyth@@ m going .
all right , all right . we &apos;re getting there . we &apos;re getting there .
the other thing that religi@@ ons know is we &apos;re not just brains , we are also bodies .
and when they teach us a lesson , they do it via the body .
so for example , take the Je@@ wish idea of for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess .
Je@@ ws are very interested in for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess and how we should start an@@ e@@ w and start af@@ res@@ h .
they don &apos;t just deliver us ser@@ mon@@ s on this .
they don &apos;t just give us books or words about this .
they tell us to have a b@@ ath .
so in Or@@ tho@@ do@@ x Je@@ wish communities , every F@@ ri@@ day you go to a M@@ ik@@ ve@@ h .
you immer@@ se yourself in the water , and a physical action bac@@ ks up a philosop@@ hi@@ cal idea .
we don &apos;t tend to do that .
our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another .
religi@@ ons are fascinating in the way they try and com@@ bine the two .
let &apos;s look at art now .
now art is something that in the se@@ cular world , we think very highly of . we think art is really , really important .
a lot of our sur@@ plus wealth goes to mus@@ eu@@ ms , etc .
we sometimes hear it said that mus@@ eu@@ ms are our new ca@@ the@@ dr@@ als , or our new ch@@ ur@@ ches .
you &apos;ve heard that saying .
now I think that the potential is there , but we &apos;ve completely let ourselves down .
and the reason we &apos;ve let ourselves down is that we &apos;re not proper@@ ly studying how religi@@ ons hand@@ le art .
the two really bad ideas that are ho@@ vering in the modern world that in@@ hi@@ bit our capacity to draw streng@@ th from art : the first idea is that art should be for art &apos;s sa@@ ke -- a ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous idea -- an idea that art should live in a her@@ me@@ tic bu@@ bble and should not try to do anything with this tr@@ ou@@ bled world .
I couldn &apos;t dis@@ agree more .
the other thing that we believe is that art shouldn &apos;t explain itself , that artists shouldn &apos;t say what they &apos;re up to , because if they said it , it might destro@@ y the sp@@ ell and we might find it too easy .
that &apos;s why a very common feeling when you &apos;re in a museum -- let &apos;s ad@@ mit it -- is , &quot; I don &apos;t know what this is about . &quot;
but if we &apos;re serious people , we don &apos;t ad@@ mit to that .
but that feeling of puzz@@ le@@ ment is struc@@ tural to con@@ tempor@@ ary art .
now religi@@ ons have a much san@@ er at@@ titude to art .
they have no trouble telling us what art is about .
art is about two things in all the major fa@@ i@@ ths .
fir@@ st@@ ly , it &apos;s trying to re@@ mind you of what there is to love .
and secon@@ dly , it &apos;s trying to re@@ mind you of what there is to fear and to hate .
and that &apos;s what art is .
art is a vis@@ cer@@ al en@@ counter with the most important ideas of your fa@@ ith .
so as you walk around a ch@@ urch , or a mos@@ que or a ca@@ the@@ dra@@ l , what you &apos;re trying to im@@ bi@@ be , what you &apos;re im@@ bi@@ bing is , through your eyes , through your sen@@ ses , tru@@ ths that have otherwise come to you through your mind .
essentially it &apos;s pro@@ p@@ ag@@ anda .
R@@ em@@ br@@ and@@ t is a pro@@ p@@ ag@@ and@@ ist in the Chris@@ tian view .
now the word &quot; pro@@ p@@ ag@@ anda &quot; s@@ ets off al@@ arm b@@ ells .
we think of H@@ it@@ ler , we think of St@@ al@@ in . don &apos;t , necessarily .
pro@@ p@@ ag@@ anda is a man@@ ner of being di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic in hon@@ or of something .
and if that thing is good , there &apos;s no problem with it at all .
my view is that mus@@ eu@@ ms should take a lea@@ f out of the book of religi@@ ons .
and they should make sure that when you walk into a museum -- if I was a museum cur@@ ator , I would make a room for love , a room for gener@@ osity .
all works of art are talking to us about things .
and if we were able to ar@@ range spaces where we could come across works where we would be told , use these works of art to c@@ ement these ideas in your mind , we would get a lot more out of art .
art would pick up the du@@ ty that it used to have and that we &apos;ve ne@@ g@@ le@@ cted because of certain m@@ is @-@ fo@@ unded ideas .
art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society .
art should be di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic .
let &apos;s think of something else .
the people in the modern world , in the se@@ cular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher sou@@ l @-@ like concer@@ ns , tend to be is@@ ol@@ ated individuals .
they &apos;re po@@ ets , they &apos;re philosop@@ her@@ s , they &apos;re photograp@@ her@@ s , they &apos;re fil@@ m@@ ma@@ kers .
and they tend to be on their own .
they &apos;re our c@@ ot@@ tage industri@@ es . they are vulner@@ able , single people .
and they get depres@@ sed and they get sad on their own .
and they don &apos;t really change much .
now think about religi@@ ons , think about organized religi@@ ons .
what do organized religi@@ ons do ?
they group together , they form institutions .
and that has all sorts of advan@@ ta@@ ges .
first of all , scale , might .
the Ca@@ tho@@ lic Ch@@ urch pul@@ led in 9@@ 7 billion dollars last year according to the W@@ all Street J@@ our@@ nal .
these are massive machines .
they &apos;re collabor@@ ative , they &apos;re br@@ and@@ ed , they &apos;re mul@@ tin@@ ational , and they &apos;re highly discipl@@ ined .
these are all very good quali@@ ties .
we recognize them in rel@@ ation to corpor@@ ations .
and corpor@@ ations are very like religi@@ ons in many ways , except they &apos;re right down at the bottom of the p@@ yrami@@ d of needs .
they &apos;re selling us shoes and cars .
whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff -- the therap@@ ists , the po@@ ets -- are on their own and they have no power , they have no might .
so religi@@ ons are the for@@ em@@ ost example of an institu@@ tion that is fighting for the things of the mind .
now we may not agree with what religi@@ ons are trying to teach us , but we can ad@@ m@@ ire the institu@@ tional way in which they &apos;re doing it .
books alone , books written by l@@ one individuals , are not going to change anything .
we need to group together .
if you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collabor@@ ative .
and that &apos;s what religi@@ ons do .
they are mul@@ tin@@ ational , as I say , they are br@@ and@@ ed , they have a clear identity , so they don &apos;t get lost in a bus@@ y world .
that &apos;s something we can learn from .
I want to con@@ clu@@ de .
really what I want to say is for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields , there is something to learn from the example of religion -- even if you don &apos;t believe any of it .
if you &apos;re involved in anything that &apos;s commun@@ al , that invol@@ ves lots of people getting together , there are things for you in religion .
if you &apos;re involved , say , in a travel industry in any way , look at pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge .
look very clos@@ ely at pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge .
we haven &apos;t be@@ gun to sc@@ rat@@ ch the surface of what travel could be because we haven &apos;t looked at what religi@@ ons do with travel .
if you &apos;re in the art world , look at the example of what religi@@ ons are doing with art .
and if you &apos;re an educ@@ ator in any way , again , look at how religi@@ ons are spre@@ ading ideas .
you may not agree with the ideas , but my go@@ od@@ ness , they &apos;re highly effective mechan@@ is@@ ms for doing so .
so really my con@@ clu@@ ding point is you may not agree with religion , but at the end of the day , religi@@ ons are so sub@@ tle , so complicated , so intelligent in many ways that they &apos;re not fit to be ab@@ and@@ oned to the religious alone ; they &apos;re for all of us .
thank you very much .
now this is actually a coura@@ ge@@ ous talk , because you &apos;re kind of setting up yourself in some ways to be ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ed in some quar@@ ters .
you can get shot by both sides .
you can get shot by the hard @-@ head@@ ed a@@ thei@@ sts , and you can get shot by those who fully believe .
in@@ coming mis@@ si@@ les from North Oxford at any moment .
indeed .
but you left out one as@@ pect of religion that a lot of people might say your agen@@ da could bor@@ row from , which is this sense -- that &apos;s actually probably the most important thing to anyone who &apos;s religious -- of spiri@@ tual experience , of some kind of connection with something that &apos;s bigger than you are .
is there any room for that experience in A@@ thei@@ s@@ m 2.@@ 0 ?
absolutely . I , like many of you , meet people who say things like , &quot; B@@ ut isn &apos;t there something bigger than us , something else ? &quot;
and I say , &quot; O@@ f course . &quot; and they say , &quot; So aren &apos;t you sort of religious ? &quot;
and I go , &quot; No . &quot; why does that sense of my@@ stery , that sense of the di@@ zz@@ ying scale of the universe , need to be ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ ed by a my@@ sti@@ cal feeling ?
science and just observ@@ ation gives us that feeling without it , so I don &apos;t feel the need .
the universe is large and we are tiny , without the need for further religious super@@ structure .
so one can have so @-@ called spiri@@ tual moments without belief in the spirit .
actually , let me just ask a question .
how many people here would say that religion is important to them ?
is there an equivalent process by which there &apos;s a sort of bridge between what you &apos;re talking about and what you would say to them ?
I would say that there are many , many g@@ aps in se@@ cular life and these can be pl@@ ug@@ ged .
it &apos;s not as though , as I try to sug@@ gest , it &apos;s not as though either you have religion and then you have to acc@@ ept all sorts of things , or you don &apos;t have religion and then you &apos;re cut off from all these very good things .
it &apos;s so sad that we constantly say , &quot; I don &apos;t believe so I can &apos;t have community , so I &apos;m cut off from mor@@ ality , so I can &apos;t go on a pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge . &quot;
one wants to say , &quot; N@@ on@@ sense . why not ? &quot;
and that &apos;s really the spirit of my talk .
there &apos;s so much we can absor@@ b .
a@@ thei@@ s@@ m shouldn &apos;t cut itself off from the rich sources of religion .
it seems to me that there &apos;s pl@@ enty of people in the TED community who are a@@ thei@@ sts .
but probably most people in the community certainly don &apos;t think that religion is going away any time soon and want to find the language to have a con@@ struc@@ tive di@@ alog@@ ue and to feel like we can actually talk to each other and at least share some things in common .
are we fo@@ ol@@ ish to be optim@@ istic about the possibility of a world where , instead of religion being the great r@@ all@@ ying c@@ ry of divi@@ de and war , that there could be bri@@ d@@ ging ?
no , we need to be poli@@ te about differences .
Po@@ li@@ ten@@ ess is a much @-@ over@@ looked virtu@@ e .
it &apos;s seen as hypo@@ c@@ ris@@ y .
but we need to get to a stage when you &apos;re an a@@ thei@@ st and someone says , &quot; Well you know , I did pra@@ y the other day , &quot; you poli@@ t@@ ely ignor@@ e it .
you move on .
because you &apos;ve agre@@ ed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you poli@@ t@@ ely diff@@ er .
and I think that &apos;s what the religious war@@ s of late have ignor@@ ed .
they &apos;ve ignor@@ ed the possibility of har@@ mon@@ i@@ ous dis@@ agre@@ ement .
and finally , does this new thing that you &apos;re pro@@ pos@@ ing that &apos;s not a religion but something else , does it need a leader , and are you volunte@@ ering to be the pop@@ e ?
well , one thing that we &apos;re all very sus@@ pi@@ cious of is individual leaders .
it doesn &apos;t need it .
what I &apos;ve tried to lay out is a fra@@ me@@ work and I &apos;m hop@@ ing that people can just fill it in .
I &apos;ve sk@@ et@@ ched a sort of bro@@ ad fra@@ me@@ work .
but wher@@ ever you are , as I say , if you &apos;re in the travel industry , do that travel bit .
if you &apos;re in the commun@@ al industry , look at religion and do the commun@@ al bit .
so it &apos;s a wi@@ k@@ i project .
A@@ la@@ in , thank you for spar@@ king many conver@@ sa@@ tions later .
A@@ la@@ in de B@@ ot@@ ton : a@@ thei@@ s@@ m 2.@@ 0
what as@@ pe@@ cts of religion should a@@ thei@@ sts adop@@ t ? A@@ la@@ in de B@@ ot@@ ton sugges@@ ts a &quot; religion for a@@ thei@@ sts &quot; -- call it A@@ thei@@ s@@ m 2.@@ 0 -- that in@@ corpor@@ ates religious forms and tradi@@ tions to sa@@ tis@@ fy our human need for connection , ri@@ tual and trans@@ cen@@ dence .
I would like to talk today about what I think is one of the greatest ad@@ vent@@ ures human beings have embar@@ ked upon , which is the qu@@ est to understand the universe and our place in it .
my own interest in this subject , and my passion for it , began rather acci@@ dent@@ ally .
I had bought a copy of this book , &quot; The U@@ ni@@ verse and Dr. Einstein &quot; -- a used pap@@ er@@ back from a secon@@ d@@ hand bo@@ ok@@ store in Se@@ attle .
a few years after that , in B@@ ang@@ al@@ ore , I was finding it hard to fall as@@ le@@ ep one night , and I picked up this book , thinking it would put me to sleep in 10 minutes .
and as it happened , I read it from mi@@ d@@ night to five in the morning in one shot .
and I was left with this inten@@ se feeling of a@@ we and ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ation at the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do .
and that feeling hasn &apos;t left me yet .
that feeling was the tri@@ g@@ ger for me to actually change my career -- from being a software engineer to become a science writer -- so that I could par@@ take in the joy of science , and also the joy of communic@@ ating it to others .
and that feeling also led me to a pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge of sorts , to go literally to the ends of the earth to see teles@@ cop@@ es , dete@@ ctors , instru@@ ments that people are building , or have built , in order to pro@@ be the cos@@ mo@@ s in greater and greater detail .
so it took me from places like Chi@@ le -- the A@@ t@@ ac@@ ama Des@@ ert in Chi@@ le -- to Si@@ ber@@ ia , to under@@ ground min@@ es in the Japanese Al@@ ps , in Nor@@ thern America , all the way to Antar@@ c@@ tic@@ a and even to the South P@@ ole .
and today I would like to share with you some images , some stories of these tri@@ ps .
I have been basically spending the last few years docum@@ enting the eff@@ or@@ ts of some extremely in@@ tre@@ p@@ id men and women who are putting , literally at times , their lives at sta@@ ke working in some very remote and very hos@@ tile places so that they may ga@@ ther the fa@@ in@@ test signals from the cos@@ mo@@ s in order for us to understand this universe .
and I first begin with a p@@ ie ch@@ art -- and I promise this is the only p@@ ie ch@@ art in the whole pres@@ entation -- but it s@@ ets up the state of our knowledge of the cos@@ mo@@ s .
all the the@@ ories in physics that we have today proper@@ ly explain what is called normal matter -- the stuff that we &apos;re all made of -- and that &apos;s four percent of the universe .
astronom@@ ers and cos@@ m@@ ologists and physic@@ ists think that there is something called dark matter in the universe , which makes up 23 percent of the universe , and something called dark energy , which per@@ me@@ ates the fabri@@ c of space @-@ time , that makes up another 7@@ 3 percent .
so if you look at this p@@ ie ch@@ art , 9@@ 6 percent of the universe , at this point in our explor@@ ation of it , is unk@@ no@@ wn or not well understood .
and most of the experiments , teles@@ cop@@ es that I went to see are in some way addres@@ sing this question , these two t@@ win mysteri@@ es of dark matter and dark energy .
I will take you first to an under@@ ground mine in Nor@@ thern M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota where people are looking for something called dark matter .
and the idea here is that they are looking for a sign of a dark matter partic@@ le hit@@ ting one of their dete@@ ctors .
and the reason why they have to go under@@ ground is that , if you did this experiment on the surface of the Earth , the same experiment would be s@@ w@@ amp@@ ed by signals that could be created by things like cos@@ mic ra@@ ys , ambi@@ ent radio activity , even our own bodies . you might not believe it , but even our own bodies are radi@@ o@@ active enough to dis@@ tur@@ b this experiment .
so they go deep inside min@@ es to find a kind of environmental sil@@ ence that will allow them to hear the ping of a dark matter partic@@ le hit@@ ting their dete@@ ctor .
and I went to see one of these experiments , and this is actually -- you can bar@@ ely see it , and the reason for that is it &apos;s entirely dark in there -- this is a ca@@ ver@@ n that was left behind by the min@@ ers who left this mine in 1960 .
and physic@@ ists came and started using it some@@ time in the 198@@ 0s .
and the min@@ ers in the early part of the last century worked , literally , in c@@ and@@ l@@ el@@ ight .
and today , you would see this inside the mine , half a mile under@@ ground .
this is one of the largest under@@ ground lab@@ s in the world .
and , among other things , they &apos;re looking for dark matter .
there is another way to search for dark matter , which is indi@@ rec@@ tly .
if dark matter exists in our universe , in our galaxy , then these particles should be sm@@ ash@@ ing together and producing other particles that we know about -- one of them being neu@@ trin@@ os .
and neu@@ trin@@ os you can dete@@ ct by the sig@@ nature they leave when they hit water molecules .
when a neu@@ trin@@ o h@@ its a water molecule it em@@ its a kind of blue light , a flas@@ h of blue light , and by looking for this blue light , you can essentially understand something about the neu@@ trin@@ o and then , indi@@ rec@@ tly , something about the dark matter that might have created this neu@@ trin@@ o .
but you need very , very large vol@@ um@@ es of water in order to do this .
you need something like tens of me@@ g@@ at@@ ons of water -- almost a gi@@ g@@ at@@ on of water -- in order to have any chance of cat@@ ching this neu@@ trin@@ o .
and where in the world would you find such water ?
well the Russi@@ ans have a t@@ ank in their own back@@ y@@ ard .
this is La@@ ke Ba@@ ik@@ al .
it is the largest la@@ ke in the world . it &apos;s 800 k@@ m long .
it &apos;s about 40 to 50 k@@ m wide in most places , and one to two kilometers deep .
and what the Russi@@ ans are doing is they &apos;re building these dete@@ ctors and immer@@ sing them about a k@@ il@@ om@@ eter ben@@ e@@ ath the surface of the la@@ ke so that they can watch for these flas@@ hes of blue light .
and this is the scene that gre@@ et@@ ed me when I land@@ ed there .
this is La@@ ke Ba@@ ik@@ al in the pe@@ ak of the Si@@ ber@@ ian win@@ ter .
the la@@ ke is entirely fro@@ zen .
and the line of black dots that you see in the background , that &apos;s the ice c@@ amp where the physic@@ ists are working .
the reason why they have to work in win@@ ter is because they don &apos;t have the money to work in summer and spring , which , if they did that , they would need ships and sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bles to do their work .
so they wait until win@@ ter -- the la@@ ke is completely fro@@ zen over -- and they use this meter @-@ th@@ ick ice as a plat@@ form on which to establ@@ ish their ice c@@ amp and do their work .
so this is the Russi@@ ans working on the ice in the pe@@ ak of the Si@@ ber@@ ian win@@ ter .
they have to dri@@ ll holes in the ice , di@@ ve down into the water -- cold , cold water -- to get hold of the instrument , bring it up , do any re@@ pa@@ irs and ma@@ inten@@ ance that they need to do , put it back and get out before the ice mel@@ ts .
because that ph@@ ase of soli@@ d ice la@@ sts for two months and it &apos;s full of cra@@ cks .
and you have to imagine , there &apos;s an entire sea @-@ like la@@ ke underneath , moving .
I still don &apos;t understand this one Russi@@ an man working in his b@@ are ch@@ est , but that tells you how hard he was working .
and these people , a hand@@ ful of people , have been working for 20 years , looking for particles that may or may not exist .
and they have de@@ dic@@ ated their lives to it .
and just to give you an idea , they have spent 20 million over 20 years .
it &apos;s very har@@ s@@ h conditions .
they work on a sho@@ es@@ tr@@ ing budget .
the toi@@ lets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a wo@@ o@@ den sh@@ ack .
and it &apos;s that basic , but they do this every year .
from Si@@ ber@@ ia to the A@@ t@@ ac@@ ama Des@@ ert in Chi@@ le , to see something called The Ver@@ y Lar@@ ge T@@ el@@ es@@ cope .
the Ver@@ y Lar@@ ge T@@ el@@ es@@ cope is one of these things that astronom@@ ers do -- they name their teles@@ cop@@ es rather uni@@ mag@@ in@@ atively .
I can tell you for a fact , that the next one that they &apos;re planning is called The Ex@@ tre@@ m@@ ely Lar@@ ge T@@ el@@ es@@ cope .
and you wouldn &apos;t believe it , but the one after that is going to be called The O@@ ver@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ingly Lar@@ ge T@@ el@@ es@@ cope .
but non@@ eth@@ eless , it &apos;s an extraordinary piece of engineering .
these are four 8@@ .@@ 2 meter teles@@ cop@@ es .
and these teles@@ cop@@ es , among other things , they &apos;re being used to study how the exp@@ an@@ sion of the universe is changing with time .
and the more you understand that , the better you would understand what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about .
and one piece of engineering that I want to leave you with as reg@@ ards this teles@@ cope is the mir@@ ror .
and that &apos;s the kind of pol@@ ishing that these mir@@ r@@ ors have en@@ du@@ red .
an extraordinary set of teles@@ cop@@ es .
here &apos;s another view of the same .
the reason why you have to build these teles@@ cop@@ es in places like the A@@ t@@ ac@@ ama Des@@ ert is because of the high al@@ titude desert .
the dry air is really good for teles@@ cop@@ es , and also , the cloud cover is below the sum@@ mit of these moun@@ tains so that the teles@@ cop@@ es have about 300 days of clear sk@@ ies .
finally , I want to take you to Antar@@ c@@ tic@@ a .
I want to spend most of my time on this part of the world .
this is cos@@ m@@ ology &apos;s final fron@@ tier .
some of the most amazing experiments , some of the most extreme experiments , are being done in Antar@@ c@@ tic@@ a .
I was there to view something called a long @-@ dur@@ ation bal@@ lo@@ on flight , which basically takes teles@@ cop@@ es and instru@@ ments all the way to the u@@ pper atmosphere , the u@@ pper strat@@ osp@@ here , 40 k@@ m up .
and that &apos;s where they do their experiments , and then the bal@@ lo@@ on , the pa@@ y@@ load , is brought down .
so this is us land@@ ing on the Ros@@ s I@@ ce S@@ hel@@ f in Antar@@ c@@ tic@@ a .
that &apos;s an American C @-@ 17 car@@ go plane that fle@@ w us from New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and to Mc@@ M@@ ur@@ do in Antar@@ c@@ tic@@ a .
and here we are about to board our bus .
and I don &apos;t know if you can read the le@@ t@@ ter@@ ing , but it says , &quot; I@@ van the Ter@@ ri@@ bus . &quot;
and that &apos;s taking us to Mc@@ M@@ ur@@ do .
and this is the scene that gre@@ ets you in Mc@@ M@@ ur@@ do .
and you bar@@ ely might be able to make out this h@@ ut here .
this h@@ ut was built by Robert F@@ al@@ con Scot@@ t and his men when they first came to Antar@@ c@@ tic@@ a on their first expe@@ di@@ tion to go to the South P@@ ole .
because it &apos;s so cold , the entire cont@@ ents of that h@@ ut is still as they left it , with the re@@ m@@ nan@@ ts of the last me@@ al they coo@@ ked still there .
it &apos;s an extraordinary place .
this is Mc@@ M@@ ur@@ do itself . about a thousand people work here in summer , and about 200 in win@@ ter when it &apos;s completely dark for six months .
I was here to see the la@@ unch of this particular type of instrument .
this is a cos@@ mic ray experiment that has been launched all the way to the u@@ pper @-@ strat@@ osp@@ here to an al@@ titude of 40 k@@ m .
what I want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight .
so you &apos;re using a bal@@ lo@@ on to carry something that is two tons all the way to an al@@ titude of 40 k@@ m .
and the engineers , the techni@@ ci@@ ans , the physic@@ ists have all got to assem@@ ble on the Ros@@ s I@@ ce S@@ hel@@ f , because Antar@@ c@@ tic@@ a -- I won &apos;t go into the reasons why -- but it &apos;s one of the most favor@@ able places for doing these bal@@ lo@@ on la@@ un@@ ches , except for the weather .
the weather , as you can imagine , this is summer , and you &apos;re standing on 200 ft of ice .
and there &apos;s a vol@@ can@@ o behind , which has gl@@ aci@@ ers at the very top .
and what they have to do is they have to assem@@ ble the entire bal@@ lo@@ on -- the fabri@@ c , par@@ ach@@ ute and everything -- on the ice and then fill it up with hel@@ ium .
and that process takes about two hours .
and the weather can change as they &apos;re putting together this whole assem@@ bly .
for instance , here they are la@@ ying down the bal@@ lo@@ on fabri@@ c behind , which is eventually going to be filled up with hel@@ ium .
those two tru@@ cks you see at the very end carry 12 tan@@ ks each of comp@@ res@@ sed hel@@ ium .
now , in case the weather changes before the la@@ unch , they have to actually p@@ ack everything back up into their bo@@ xes and take it out back to Mc@@ M@@ ur@@ do Sta@@ tion .
and this particular bal@@ lo@@ on , because it has to la@@ unch two tons of weight , is an extremely huge bal@@ lo@@ on .
the fabri@@ c alone wei@@ gh@@ s two tons .
in order to minim@@ ize the weight , it &apos;s very thin , it &apos;s as thin as a sand@@ wi@@ ch wr@@ app@@ er .
and if they have to p@@ ack it back , they have to put it into bo@@ xes and st@@ amp on it so that it f@@ its into the box again -- except , when they did it first , it would have been done in Texas .
here , they can &apos;t do it with the kind shoes they &apos;re wearing , so they have to take their shoes off , get bar@@ e@@ foot into the bo@@ xes , in this cold , and do that kind of work .
that &apos;s the kind of de@@ dic@@ ation these people have .
here &apos;s the bal@@ lo@@ on being filled up with hel@@ ium , and you can see it &apos;s a gor@@ ge@@ ous sight .
here &apos;s a scene that shows you the bal@@ lo@@ on and the pa@@ y@@ load end @-@ to @-@ end .
so the bal@@ lo@@ on is being filled up with hel@@ ium on the left @-@ hand side , and the fabri@@ c actually r@@ uns all the way to the middle where there &apos;s a piece of electron@@ ics and expl@@ osi@@ ves being connected to a par@@ ach@@ ute , and then the par@@ ach@@ ute is then connected to the pa@@ y@@ load .
and remember , all this wir@@ ing is being done by people in extreme cold , in sub @-@ zero temper@@ atures .
they &apos;re wearing about 15 k@@ g of clo@@ thing and stuff , but they have to take their glo@@ ves off in order to do that .
and I would like to share with you a la@@ unch .
radio : okay , rel@@ ease the bal@@ lo@@ on , rel@@ ease the bal@@ lo@@ on , rel@@ ease the bal@@ lo@@ on .
A@@ ni@@ l An@@ an@@ th@@ as@@ w@@ am@@ y : and I &apos;ll finally like to leave you with two images .
this is an observ@@ atory in the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ as , in La@@ da@@ k@@ h in India .
and the thing I want you to look at here is the teles@@ cope on the right @-@ hand side .
and on the far left there is a 400 year @-@ old Budd@@ h@@ ist mon@@ a@@ stery .
this is a close @-@ up of the Budd@@ h@@ ist mon@@ a@@ stery .
and I was stru@@ ck by the ju@@ x@@ t@@ ap@@ os@@ ition of these two enormous discipl@@ ines that humanity has .
one is explor@@ ing the cos@@ mo@@ s on the outside , and the other one is explor@@ ing our inter@@ ior being .
and both requ@@ ire sil@@ ence of some sort .
and what stru@@ ck me was every place that I went to to see these teles@@ cop@@ es , the astronom@@ ers and cos@@ m@@ ologists are in search of a certain kind of sil@@ ence , whether it &apos;s sil@@ ence from radio poll@@ ution or light poll@@ ution or whatever .
and it was very obvious that , if we destro@@ y these sil@@ ent places on Earth , we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look out@@ wards , because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from ou@@ ter space .
thank you .
A@@ ni@@ l An@@ an@@ th@@ as@@ w@@ am@@ y : what it takes to do extreme astro@@ physics
all over the planet , giant teles@@ cop@@ es and dete@@ ctors are looking for clu@@ es to the work@@ ings of the universe . at the I@@ N@@ K Con@@ ference , science writer A@@ ni@@ l An@@ an@@ th@@ as@@ w@@ am@@ y t@@ ours us around these amazing install@@ ations , taking us to some of the most remote and sil@@ ent places on Earth .
we really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children .
if we don &apos;t do that , we &apos;re going to get the generation we des@@ erve .
they &apos;re going to learn from whatever it is they have around them .
and we , as now the el@@ ite , parents , libr@@ ari@@ ans , profession@@ als , whatever it is , a bunch of our ac@@ tivi@@ ties are , in fact , in trying to get the best we have to offer within reach of those around us , or as bro@@ ad@@ ly as we can .
I &apos;m going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are car@@ ved in stone .
one is what &apos;s on the Boston P@@ u@@ bli@@ c Li@@ br@@ ary .
car@@ ved above their door is , &quot; F@@ ree to All . &quot;
it &apos;s kind of an in@@ spir@@ ing stat@@ ement , and I &apos;ll go back at the end of this .
I &apos;m a libr@@ arian , and what I &apos;m trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge to as many people as want to read it .
and the idea of using technology is perfect for us .
I think we have the opportunity to one @-@ up the Gre@@ e@@ ks .
it &apos;s not easy to one @-@ up the Gre@@ e@@ ks . but with the industri@@ ous@@ ness of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , they were able to build the Li@@ br@@ ary of Alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a -- the idea of a copy of every book of all the pe@@ op@@ les of the world .
the problem was you actually had to go to Alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a to go to it .
on the other hand , if you did , then great things happened .
I think we can one @-@ up the Gre@@ e@@ ks and achieve something .
and I &apos;m going to try to argue only one point today : that universal access to all knowledge is within our gr@@ as@@ p .
so if I &apos;m successful , then you &apos;ll actually come away thinking , yeah , we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published , everything that was ever meant for distribution , available to anybody in the world that &apos;s ever wanted to have access to it .
yes , there &apos;s issues about how money should be distribu@@ ted , and that &apos;s still being re@@ figured out .
but I &apos;d say there &apos;s pl@@ enty of money , and there &apos;s pl@@ enty of demand , so we can actually achieve that .
but I &apos;m going to go over the technologi@@ cal , social and sort of where are we as a whole , trying to get to that particular vision .
and the way I &apos;m going to try to do this is do it like the Ama@@ z@@ on@@ .com website , the books , music , video and just go step -- media type by media type , just go and say , all right , how &apos;re we doing on this ?
so if we start with books , you know , sort of where are we ?
well , first you have to , as an engineer , sc@@ ope the problem . how big is it ?
if you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available , well , how big a problem is it ?
well , we don &apos;t really know , but the largest print libr@@ ary in the world is the Li@@ br@@ ary of Con@@ gress . it &apos;s 26 million vol@@ um@@ es , 26 million vol@@ um@@ es .
it is , by far and away , the largest print libr@@ ary in the world .
and a book , if you had a book , is about a me@@ g@@ ab@@ y@@ te , so -- you know , if you had it in Microsoft Wor@@ d .
so a me@@ g@@ ab@@ y@@ te , 26 million me@@ g@@ ab@@ y@@ tes is 26 ter@@ ab@@ y@@ tes -- it goes me@@ ga@@ - , gi@@ ga@@ - , ter@@ a@@ - . 26 ter@@ ab@@ y@@ tes .
26 ter@@ ab@@ y@@ tes f@@ its in a computer system that &apos;s about this big , on sp@@ inning Lin@@ u@@ x dri@@ ves , and it costs about 6@@ 0,000 dollars .
so for the cost of a house -- or around here , a gar@@ age -- you can put , you can have sp@@ inning all of the words in the Li@@ br@@ ary of Con@@ gress .
that &apos;s pretty ne@@ at .
then the question is , what do you get ?
you know , is it worth trying to get there ?
do you actually want it online ?
some of the first things that people do is they make book re@@ a@@ ders that allow you to search inside the books , and that &apos;s kind of fun .
and you can down@@ load these things , and look around them in new and different ways .
and you can get at them re@@ mot@@ ely , if you happen to have a l@@ aptop .
there &apos;s starting to be some of these sort of page turn @-@ y inter@@ faces that look a whole lot like books in certain ways , and you can search them , make little t@@ ab@@ s , and it &apos;s kind of cu@@ te -- still very book @-@ like -- on your l@@ aptop .
but I don &apos;t know , reading things on a l@@ aptop -- whenever I pull up my l@@ aptop , it always feels like work .
I think that &apos;s one of the reasons why the K@@ in@@ d@@ le is so great .
I don &apos;t have to feel like I &apos;m at work to read a K@@ in@@ d@@ le .
it &apos;s starting to be a little bit more speci@@ fied .
but I have to say that there &apos;s older technologies that I tend to like .
I like the physical book .
and I think we can go and use our technology to go and di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze things , put them on the N@@ et , and then down@@ load , print them and b@@ ind them , and end up with books again .
and we sort of said , well , how hard is this ?
and it turns out to not be very hard .
we actually went off to make a bo@@ ok@@ mobile .
and a bo@@ ok@@ mobile -- the size of a van with a satelli@@ te dis@@ h , a prin@@ ter , bin@@ der and c@@ utter , and kids make their own books .
it costs about three dollars to down@@ load , print and b@@ ind a normal , old book .
and they actually come out kind of nice looking .
you can actually get really good @-@ looking books for on the order of one pen@@ ny per page , sort of the parts cost for doing this .
so the idea of -- this technology actually may end up putting books back in people &apos;s hands again .
there are some other bo@@ ok@@ mo@@ bil@@ es running around .
this is Eric El@@ dre@@ d making books at Wal@@ den P@@ ond -- Th@@ or@@ ea@@ u &apos;s works .
this is just before he got ki@@ cked out by the Par@@ ks Ser@@ vi@@ ces , for comp@@ eting with the bo@@ ok@@ store there .
in India , they &apos;ve got another couple bo@@ ok@@ mo@@ bil@@ es running around .
and this is the opening day at the Li@@ br@@ ary of Alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a , the new Li@@ br@@ ary of Alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a , in Egyp@@ t .
it was quite pop@@ ul@@ arly atten@@ ded .
and kids starting to make their own books , and a happy kid with the first book that he &apos;s ever ow@@ ned .
so the idea of being able to use this technology to end up with paper where I can hand@@ le sort of sounds a little re@@ tr@@ o , but I think it still has its place .
and being from the S@@ ili@@ con Valley , sort of ut@@ op@@ ian sort of world , we thought , if we can make this technology work in rural Uganda , we might have something .
so we actually got some fund@@ ing from the World Bank to try it out .
and we found in about 30 days we could go and take a couple fol@@ ks from S@@ ili@@ con Valley , fly them to Uganda , buy a car , set up the first Internet connection at the National Li@@ br@@ ary of Uganda , figure out what they wanted , and get a program going making books in rural Uganda .
and it actually -- so technologi@@ cally , it works .
what we found out of this is we didn &apos;t have the right books .
so the books were in the libr@@ ary . we could get it to people , if they &apos;re di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed , but we didn &apos;t know how to quite get them di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed .
everybody thought the answer is , send things to India and China .
and so we &apos;ve tried that , and I &apos;ll go over that in a moment .
there are some ne@@ wer technologies for deli@@ vering that have happened that are actually quite exciting as well .
one is a print @-@ on @-@ demand machine that looks like a Ru@@ be Gol@@ d@@ berg machine .
we have one of these things now . it &apos;s completely cool .
it &apos;s all con@@ ve@@ yo@@ r b@@ elt , and it makes a book .
and it &apos;s called the &quot; E@@ sp@@ res@@ so Bo@@ ok M@@ ach@@ ine , &quot; and in about 10 minutes , you can press a bu@@ tt@@ on and make a book .
something else I &apos;m quite excited about in this particular dom@@ ain , beyond these sort of ki@@ os@@ k @-@ y things where you can get books on demand , is some of these new little scre@@ ens that are coming out .
and one of my favor@@ ites in this is the $ 100 l@@ aptop .
and I don &apos;t mean to ste@@ al any th@@ under here , but we &apos;ve gone and used one of these things to be an e @-@ book re@@ a@@ der .
so here &apos;s one of the be@@ t@@ a un@@ its and you can -- it actually turns out to be a really good @-@ looking e @-@ book re@@ a@@ der .
and we have a quick h@@ ack that we did to try to put one of our books on it , and it turns out that 200 dots per in@@ ch means that you can put scan@@ ned books on them that look really good .
at 200 dots per in@@ ch , it &apos;s kind of the equivalent of a 300 do@@ t print las@@ er prin@@ ter .
we &apos;re in good enough shape .
you actually can go and read scan@@ ned books quite easily .
so the idea of electron@@ ic books is starting to come about .
but how do you go about doing all this scan@@ ning ?
so we thought , okay , well , let &apos;s try out this send books to India thing .
and there was a project with , fund@@ ed by the National Science Foundation -- sent a bunch of scan@@ ners , and the American libr@@ aries were supposed to send books .
well , they didn &apos;t . they didn &apos;t want to send their books .
so we bought 100,000 books and sent them to India .
and then we learned why you don &apos;t want to send books to India .
the lesson we learned out of this is , s@@ can your own books .
if you really care about books , you &apos;re going to s@@ can them better , especially if they &apos;re valu@@ able books .
if they &apos;re new books and you can just , you know , b@@ ut@@ cher them , because you could just buy another one , that &apos;s not such a big deal in terms of doing high @-@ quality scan@@ ning .
but do things that you love .
but the Indi@@ ans have been scan@@ ning a lot of their own books -- about 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 now -- doing very well .
the Chinese did over a million , and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans are about 3@@ 0,000 .
but we sent -- thought , OK , if we &apos;re going to need to do this , let &apos;s do it in @-@ libr@@ ary .
how do we go and do this , and how do we get it down so that it &apos;s a cost point that we could afford ?
and we sort of picked the price point of 10 c@@ ents a page .
if it &apos;s basically the cost of x@@ er@@ o@@ x@@ ing to basically di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze , O@@ C@@ R , pack@@ age it up , make it so that you could down@@ load , print and b@@ ind it -- the whole she@@ b@@ ang -- we would have achie@@ ved something .
so we started out trying to figure out . how do we get to 10 c@@ ents ?
and we tried these robot things , and they worked pretty well -- sort of these au@@ to @-@ page @-@ turning things .
if we can have Mars R@@ over@@ s , you &apos;d think you could turn pages .
but it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages , and the volu@@ me isn &apos;t there .
so anyway -- so we ended up making our own book scan@@ ner , and with two digital , high @-@ grade , professional digital c@@ ameras , controlled museum li@@ ghting , so even if it &apos;s a black and white book , you can go and get the pro@@ per in@@ ton@@ ation .
so you basically do a beautiful , respe@@ ct@@ ful job .
this is not a fa@@ x , this is -- the idea is to do a beautiful job as you &apos;re going through these libr@@ aries .
and we &apos;ve been able to achieve 10 c@@ ents a page if we run things in volu@@ me .
this is what it looks like at the University of Tor@@ onto .
and actually , it turns out to , you know , pay a living wa@@ ge .
people seem to love it .
yes , it &apos;s a little bor@@ ing , but some people kind of get into the Z@@ en of it .
and especially if it &apos;s kind of interesting books that you care about , in languages that you can read .
we actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this , at getting 10 c@@ ents a page .
so 10 c@@ ents a page , 300 pages in your average book , 30 dollars a book .
the Li@@ br@@ ary of Con@@ gress , if you did the whole dar@@ n thing -- 26 million books -- is about 7@@ 50 million dollars , right ?
but a million books , I think , actually would be a pretty good start , and that would cost 30 million dollars . that &apos;s not that big a bil@@ l .
and what we &apos;ve been able to do is get into libr@@ aries .
we &apos;ve now got eight of these scan@@ ning cen@@ ters in three countries , and libr@@ aries are up for having their books scan@@ ned .
the G@@ et@@ ty here is moving their books to the U@@ C@@ L@@ A , which is where we have one these scan@@ ning cen@@ ters , and scan@@ ning their out @-@ of @-@ cop@@ y@@ right books , which is f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous .
so we &apos;re starting to get the institu@@ tional responsibility .
the thing we &apos;re missing is the 10 c@@ ents .
if we can get the 10 c@@ ents , all the rest of it flo@@ ws .
we &apos;ve scan@@ ned about 200@@ ,000 books .
